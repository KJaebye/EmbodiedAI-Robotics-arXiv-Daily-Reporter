**Abstract**: Sense of touch that allows robots to detect contact and measure interaction forces enables them to perform challenging tasks such as grasping fragile objects or using tools. Tactile sensors in theory can equip the robots with such capabilities. However, accuracy of the measured forces is not on a par with those of the force sensors due to the potential calibration challenges and noise. This has limited the values these sensors can offer in manipulation applications that require force control. In this paper, we introduce GeoDEx, a unified estimation, planning, and control framework using geometric primitives such as plane, cone and ellipsoid, which enables dexterous as well as extrinsic manipulation in the presence of uncertain force readings. Through various experimental results, we show that while relying on direct inaccurate and noisy force readings from tactile sensors results in unstable or failed manipulation, our method enables successful grasping and extrinsic manipulation of different objects. Additionally, compared to directly running optimization using SOCP (Second Order Cone Programming), planning and force estimation using our framework achieves a 14x speed-up.

**Abstract**: As machine learning is increasingly deployed in autonomous systems, verification of neural network controllers is becoming an active research domain. Existing tools and annual verification competitions suggest that soon this technology will become effective for real-world applications. Our application comes from the emerging field of microflyers that are passively transported by the wind, which may have various uses in weather or pollution monitoring. Specifically, we investigate centimetre-scale bio-inspired gliding drones that resemble Alsomitra macrocarpa diaspores. In this paper, we propose a new case study on verifying Alsomitra-inspired drones with neural network controllers, with the aim of adhering closely to a target trajectory. We show that our system differs substantially from existing VNN and ARCH competition benchmarks, and show that a combination of tools holds promise for verifying such systems in the future, if certain shortcomings can be overcome. We propose a novel method for robust training of regression networks, and investigate formalisations of this case study in Vehicle and CORA. Our verification results suggest that the investigated training methods do improve performance and robustness of neural network controllers in this application, but are limited in scope and usefulness. This is due to systematic limitations of both Vehicle and CORA, and the complexity of our system reducing the scale of reachability, which we investigate in detail. If these limitations can be overcome, it will enable engineers to develop safe and robust technologies that improve people's lives and reduce our impact on the environment. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 随着机器学习在自主系统中的应用日益增多，神经网络控制器的验证已成为一个活跃的研究领域。现有工具和年度验证竞赛表明，这项技术不久将成为实际应用的有效手段。我们的应用来自新兴的微飞行器领域，这些微飞行器被动地由风力驱动，可能在气象或污染监测中具有多种用途。具体来说，我们研究了厘米级的仿生滑翔无人机，这些无人机类似于Alsomitra macrocarpa的种子。在本文中，我们提出了一种新的案例研究，旨在验证Alsomitra仿生无人机中的神经网络控制器，以紧密遵循目标轨迹。我们表明，我们的系统在现有VNN和ARCH竞赛基准上存在显著差异，并展示了在克服某些缺陷后，工具组合在未来验证此类系统方面的潜力。我们提出了一种新的回归网络鲁棒训练方法，并在Vehicle和CORA中探讨了这一案例研究的形式化方法。验证结果表明，所研究的训练方法确实可以提高神经网络控制器在该应用中的性能和鲁棒性，但其范围和实用性存在局限性。这是由于Vehicle和CORA的系统限制以及我们系统的复杂性降低了可达性的规模，我们在详细探讨了这些局限性后得出此结论。如果这些局限性可以被克服，将使工程师能够开发出安全和鲁棒的技术，从而改善人们的生活并减少对环境的影响。

# Decentralised, Self-Organising Drone Swarms using Coupled Oscillators 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于耦合振子的去中心化自组织无人机群 

**Authors**: Kevin Quinn, Cormac Molloy, Harun Šiljak  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00442)  

**Abstract**: The problem of robotic synchronisation and coordination is a long-standing one. Combining autonomous, computerised systems with unpredictable real-world conditions can have consequences ranging from poor performance to collisions and damage. This paper proposes using coupled oscillators to create a drone swarm that is decentralised and self organising. This allows for greater flexibility and adaptiveness than a hard-coded swarm, with more resilience and scalability than a centralised system. Our method allows for a variable number of drones to spontaneously form a swarm and react to changing swarm conditions. Additionally, this method includes provisions to prevent communication interference between drones, and signal processing techniques to ensure a smooth and cohesive swarm. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 机器人同步与协调问题是长期存在的一个问题。将自主计算机系统与不可预测的现实世界条件相结合可能会导致从性能不佳到碰撞和损坏等各种后果。本文提出使用耦合振子来创建去中心化和自组织的无人机群。这种方法提供了比硬编码群无人机更大的灵活性和适应性，同时具备中心化系统所不具备的更强的鲁棒性和扩展性。我们的方法允许无人机自发地形成群组并适应不断变化的群组条件。此外，该方法还包括防止无人机间通信干扰的机制，并运用信号处理技术确保群组的顺畅和一致性。

# A Neural Network Mode for PX4 on Embedded Flight Controllers 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于嵌入式飞行控制器的PX4神经网络模型 

**Authors**: Sindre M. Hegre, Welf Rehberg, Mihir Kulkarni, Kostas Alexis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00432)  

**Abstract**: This paper contributes an open-sourced implementation of a neural-network based controller framework within the PX4 stack. We develop a custom module for inference on the microcontroller while retaining all of the functionality of the PX4 autopilot. Policies trained in the Aerial Gym Simulator are converted to the TensorFlow Lite format and then built together with PX4 and flashed to the flight controller. The policies substitute the control-cascade within PX4 to offer an end-to-end position-setpoint tracking controller directly providing normalized motor RPM setpoints. Experiments conducted in simulation and the real-world show similar tracking performance. We thus provide a flight-ready pipeline for testing neural control policies in the real world. The pipeline simplifies the deployment of neural networks on embedded flight controller hardware thereby accelerating research on learning-based control. Both the Aerial Gym Simulator and the PX4 module are open-sourced at this https URL and this https URL. Video: this https URL.

# Holistic Optimization of Modular Robots 

**Title (ZH)**: 模块化机器人整体优化 

**Authors**: Matthias Mayer, Matthias Althoff  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00400)  

**Abstract**: Modular robots have the potential to revolutionize automation as one can optimize their composition for any given task. However, finding optimal compositions is non-trivial. In addition, different compositions require different base positions and trajectories to fully use the potential of modular robots. We address this problem holistically for the first time by jointly optimizing the composition, base placement, and trajectory, to minimize the cycle time of a given task. Our approach is evaluated on over 300 industrial benchmarks requiring point-to-point movements. Overall, we reduce cycle time by up to 25% and find feasible solutions in twice as many benchmarks compared to optimizing the module composition alone. In the first real-world validation of modular robots optimized for point-to-point movement, we find that the optimized robot is successfully deployed in nine out of ten cases in less than an hour. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 模块化机器人有潜力通过针对任何给定任务优化其组成来革新自动化。然而，找到最优组成并非易事。此外，不同的组成需要不同的基座位置和轨迹以充分挖掘模块化机器人的潜力。我们首次从整体上解决了这一问题，通过联合优化组成、基座放置和轨迹来最小化给定任务的周期时间。我们的方法在超过300个需要点到点运动的工业基准上进行了评估，总体上减少了25%的周期时间，并在两倍数量的基准上找到了可行的解决方案，与仅优化模块组成相比。在全球首个针对点到点移动优化的模块化机器人实际验证中，我们发现优化后的机器人在不到一小时内成功部署在十起案例中的九起。

# Multi-segment Soft Robot Control via Deep Koopman-based Model Predictive Control 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于深度Koopman的模型预测控制的多段软 Robotics 控制 

**Authors**: Lei Lv, Lei Liu, Lei Bao, Fuchun Sun, Jiahong Dong, Jianwei Zhang, Xuemei Shan, Kai Sun, Hao Huang, Yu Luo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00354)  

**Abstract**: Soft robots, compared to regular rigid robots, as their multiple segments with soft materials bring flexibility and compliance, have the advantages of safe interaction and dexterous operation in the environment. However, due to its characteristics of high dimensional, nonlinearity, time-varying nature, and infinite degree of freedom, it has been challenges in achieving precise and dynamic control such as trajectory tracking and position reaching. To address these challenges, we propose a framework of Deep Koopman-based Model Predictive Control (DK-MPC) for handling multi-segment soft robots. We first employ a deep learning approach with sampling data to approximate the Koopman operator, which therefore linearizes the high-dimensional nonlinear dynamics of the soft robots into a finite-dimensional linear representation. Secondly, this linearized model is utilized within a model predictive control framework to compute optimal control inputs that minimize the tracking error between the desired and actual state trajectories. The real-world experiments on the soft robot "Chordata" demonstrate that DK-MPC could achieve high-precision control, showing the potential of DK-MPC for future applications to soft robots.

# Active Contact Engagement for Aerial Navigation in Unknown Environments with Glass 

**Title (ZH)**: 在未知环境中的无人机导航中基于玻璃的主动接触参与 

**Authors**: Xinyi Chen, Yichen Zhang, Hetai Zou, Junzhe Wang, Shaojie Shen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00332)  

**Abstract**: Autonomous aerial robots are increasingly being deployed in real-world scenarios, where transparent glass obstacles present significant challenges to reliable navigation. Researchers have investigated the use of non-contact sensors and passive contact-resilient aerial vehicle designs to detect glass surfaces, which are often limited in terms of robustness and efficiency. In this work, we propose a novel approach for robust autonomous aerial navigation in unknown environments with transparent glass obstacles, combining the strengths of both sensor-based and contact-based glass detection. The proposed system begins with the incremental detection and information maintenance about potential glass surfaces using visual sensor measurements. The vehicle then actively engages in touch actions with the visually detected potential glass surfaces using a pair of lightweight contact-sensing modules to confirm or invalidate their presence. Following this, the volumetric map is efficiently updated with the glass surface information and safe trajectories are replanned on the fly to circumvent the glass obstacles. We validate the proposed system through real-world experiments in various scenarios, demonstrating its effectiveness in enabling efficient and robust autonomous aerial navigation in complex real-world environments with glass obstacles.

# J-PARSE: Jacobian-based Projection Algorithm for Resolving Singularities Effectively in Inverse Kinematic Control of Serial Manipulators 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于雅可比矩阵投影算法的 serial 连续机器人逆运动学控制奇异态有效.resolve 

**Authors**: Shivani Guptasarma, Matthew Strong, Honghao Zhen, Monroe Kennedy III  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00306)  

**Abstract**: J-PARSE is a method for smooth first-order inverse kinematic control of a serial manipulator near kinematic singularities. The commanded end-effector velocity is interpreted component-wise, according to the available mobility in each dimension of the task space. First, a substitute "Safety" Jacobian matrix is created, keeping the aspect ratio of the manipulability ellipsoid above a threshold value. The desired motion is then projected onto non-singular and singular directions, and the latter projection scaled down by a factor informed by the threshold value. A right-inverse of the non-singular Safety Jacobian is applied to the modified command. In the absence of joint limits and collisions, this ensures smooth transition into and out of low-rank poses, guaranteeing asymptotic stability for target poses within the workspace, and stability for those outside. Velocity control with J-PARSE is benchmarked against the Least-Squares and Damped Least-Squares inversions of the Jacobian, and shows high accuracy in reaching and leaving singular target poses. By expanding the available workspace of manipulators, the method finds applications in servoing, teleoperation, and learning.

# Characterizing gaussian mixture of motion modes for skid-steer state estimation 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于滑移转向运动模态高斯混合的状态估计Characterizing Gaussian Mixture of Motion Modes for Skid-steer State Estimation 

**Authors**: Ameya Salvi, Mark Brudnak, Jonathon M. Smereka, Matthias Schmid, Venkat Krovi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00200)  

**Abstract**: Skid-steered wheel mobile robots (SSWMRs) are characterized by the unique domination of the tire-terrain skidding for the robot to move. The lack of reliable friction models cascade into unreliable motion models, especially the reduced ordered variants used for state estimation and robot control. Ensemble modeling is an emerging research direction where the overall motion model is broken down into a family of local models to distribute the performance and resource requirement and provide a fast real-time prediction. To this end, a gaussian mixture model based modeling identification of model clusters is adopted and implemented within an interactive multiple model (IMM) based state estimation. The framework is adopted and implemented for angular velocity as the estimated state for a mid scaled skid-steered wheel mobile robot platform.

# Optimized Lattice-Structured Flexible EIT Sensor for Tactile Reconstruction and Classification 

**Title (ZH)**: 优化 lattice 结构的柔性电容成像传感器及其触觉重建与分类 

**Authors**: Huazhi Dong, Sihao Teng, Xu Han, Xiaopeng Wu, Francesco Giorgio-Serchi, Yunjie Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00161)  

**Abstract**: Flexible electrical impedance tomography (EIT) offers a promising alternative to traditional tactile sensing approaches, enabling low-cost, scalable, and deformable sensor designs. Here, we propose an optimized lattice-structured flexible EIT tactile sensor incorporating a hydrogel-based conductive layer, systematically designed through three-dimensional coupling field simulations to optimize structural parameters for enhanced sensitivity and robustness. By tuning the lattice channel width and conductive layer thickness, we achieve significant improvements in tactile reconstruction quality and classification performance. Experimental results demonstrate high-quality tactile reconstruction with correlation coefficients up to 0.9275, peak signal-to-noise ratios reaching 29.0303 dB, and structural similarity indexes up to 0.9660, while maintaining low relative errors down to 0.3798. Furthermore, the optimized sensor accurately classifies 12 distinct tactile stimuli with an accuracy reaching 99.6%. These results highlight the potential of simulation-guided structural optimization for advancing flexible EIT-based tactile sensors toward practical applications in wearable systems, robotics, and human-machine interfaces.

# InterLoc: LiDAR-based Intersection Localization using Road Segmentation with Automated Evaluation Method 

**Title (ZH)**: InterLoc：基于道路分割的LiDAR交点定位及自动化评估方法 

**Authors**: Nguyen Hoang Khoi Tran, Julie Stephany Berrio, Mao Shan, Zhenxing Ming, Stewart Worrall  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00512)  

**Abstract**: Intersections are geometric and functional key points in every road network. They offer strong landmarks to correct GNSS dropouts and anchor new sensor data in up-to-date maps. Despite that importance, intersection detectors either ignore the rich semantic information already computed onboard or depend on scarce, hand-labeled intersection datasets. To close that gap, this paper presents a LiDAR-based method for intersection detection that (i) fuses semantic road segmentation with vehicle localization to detect intersection candidates in a bird's eye view (BEV) representation and (ii) refines those candidates by analyzing branch topology with a least squares formulation. To evaluate our method, we introduce an automated benchmarking pipeline that pairs detections with OpenStreetMap (OSM) intersection nodes using precise GNSS/INS ground-truth poses. Tested on eight SemanticKITTI sequences, the approach achieves a mean localization error of 1.9 m, 89% precision, and 77% recall at a 5 m tolerance, outperforming the latest learning-based baseline. Moreover, the method is robust to segmentation errors higher than those of the benchmark model, demonstrating its applicability in the real world.

# Guidance and Control of Unmanned Surface Vehicles via HEOL 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于HEOL的自主水面车辆的指导与控制 

**Authors**: Loïck Degorre, Emmanuel Delaleau, Cédric Join, Michel Fliess  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00168)  

**Abstract**: This work presents a new approach to the guidance and control of marine craft via HEOL, i.e., a new way of combining flatness-based and model-free controllers. Its goal is to develop a general regulator for Unmanned Surface Vehicles (USV). To do so, the well-known USV maneuvering model is simplified into a nominal Hovercraft model which is flat. A flatness-based controller is derived for the simplified USV model and the loop is closed via an intelligent proportional-derivative (iPD) regulator. We thus associate the well-documented natural robustness of flatness-based control and adaptivity of iPDs. The controller is applied in simulation to two surface vessels, one meeting the simplifying hypotheses, the other one being a generic USV of the literature. It is shown to stabilize both systems even in the presence of unmodeled environmental disturbances.

**Authors**: Alex Schutz, Yang You, Matias Mattamala, Ipek Caliskanelli, Bruno Lacerda, Nick Hawes  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.00596)  

**Abstract**: Deterministic partially observable Markov decision processes (DetPOMDPs) often arise in planning problems where the agent is uncertain about its environmental state but can act and observe deterministically. In this paper, we propose DetMCVI, an adaptation of the Monte Carlo Value Iteration (MCVI) algorithm for DetPOMDPs, which builds policies in the form of finite-state controllers (FSCs). DetMCVI solves large problems with a high success rate, outperforming existing baselines for DetPOMDPs. We also verify the performance of the algorithm in a real-world mobile robot forest mapping scenario.
