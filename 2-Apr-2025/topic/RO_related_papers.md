**Abstract**: This article addresses time-optimal path planning for a vehicle capable of moving both forward and backward on a unit sphere with a unit maximum speed, and constrained by a maximum absolute turning rate $U_{max}$. The proposed formulation can be utilized for optimal attitude control of underactuated satellites, optimal motion planning for spherical rolling robots, and optimal path planning for mobile robots on spherical surfaces or uneven terrains. By utilizing Pontryagin's Maximum Principle and analyzing phase portraits, it is shown that for $U_{max}\geq1$, the optimal path connecting a given initial configuration to a desired terminal configuration falls within a sufficient list of 23 path types, each comprising at most 6 segments. These segments belong to the set $\{C,G,T\}$, where $C$ represents a tight turn with radius $r=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+U_{max}^2}}$, $G$ represents a great circular arc, and $T$ represents a turn-in-place motion. Closed-form expressions for the angles of each path in the sufficient list are derived. The source code for solving the time-optimal path problem and visualization is publicly available at this https URL.

**Title (ZH)**: 受限环境中四旋翼无人机的联合空中协同吊装与路径规划 

**Authors**: Marios-Nektarios Stamatopoulos, Panagiotis Koustoumpardis, Achilleas Santi Seisa, George Nikolakopoulos

**Abstract**: In this article, a novel combined aerial cooperative tethered carrying and path planning framework is introduced with a special focus on applications in confined environments. The proposed work is aiming towards solving the path planning problem for the formation of two quadrotors, while having a rope hanging below them and passing through or around obstacles. A novel composition mechanism is proposed, which simplifies the degrees of freedom of the combined aerial system and expresses the corresponding states in a compact form. Given the state of the composition, a dynamic body is generated that encapsulates the quadrotors-rope system and makes the procedure of collision checking between the system and the environment more efficient. By utilizing the above two abstractions, an RRT path planning scheme is implemented and a collision-free path for the formation is generated. This path is decomposed back to the quadrotors' desired positions that are fed to the Model Predictive Controller (MPC) for each one. The efficiency of the proposed framework is experimentally evaluated.

# Predictive Spray Switching for an Efficient Path Planning Pattern for Area Coverage 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于区域覆盖的高效路径规划模式的预测喷洒切换算法 

**Authors**: Mogens Plessen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00732)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents within an arable farming context a predictive logic for the on- and off-switching of a set of nozzles attached to a boom aligned along a working width and carried by a machinery with the purpose of applying spray along the working width while the machinery is traveling along a specific path planning pattern. Concatenation of multiple of those path patterns and corresponding concatenation of proposed switching logics enables nominal lossless spray application for area coverage tasks. Proposed predictive switching logic is compared to the common and state-of-the-art reactive switching logic for Boustrophedon-based path planning for area coverage. The trade-off between reduction in pathlength and increase in the number of required on- and off-switchings for proposed method is discussed.

# Design and Validation of an Intention-Aware Probabilistic Framework for Trajectory Prediction: Integrating COLREGS, Grounding Hazards, and Planned Routes 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于意图感知的概率预测框架设计与验证：整合COLREGS、搁浅风险和计划航线 

**Authors**: Dhanika Mahipala, Trym Tengesdal, Børge Rokseth, Tor Arne Johansen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00731)  

**Abstract**: Collision avoidance capability is an essential component in an autonomous vessel navigation system. To this end, an accurate prediction of dynamic obstacle trajectories is vital. Traditional approaches to trajectory prediction face limitations in generalizability and often fail to account for the intentions of other vessels. While recent research has considered incorporating the intentions of dynamic obstacles, these efforts are typically based on the own-ship's interpretation of the situation. The current state-of-the-art in this area is a Dynamic Bayesian Network (DBN) model, which infers target vessel intentions by considering multiple underlying causes and allowing for different interpretations of the situation by different vessels. However, since its inception, there have not been any significant structural improvements to this model. In this paper, we propose enhancing the DBN model by incorporating considerations for grounding hazards and vessel waypoint information. The proposed model is validated using real vessel encounters extracted from historical Automatic Identification System (AIS) data.

# Optimal Control of Walkers with Parallel Actuation 

**Title (ZH)**: 平行驱动下步行者最优控制 

**Authors**: Ludovic de Matteis, Virgile Batto, Justin Carpentier, Nicolas Mansard  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00642)  

**Abstract**: Legged robots with closed-loop kinematic chains are increasingly prevalent due to their increased mobility and efficiency. Yet, most motion generation methods rely on serial-chain approximations, sidestepping their specific constraints and dynamics. This leads to suboptimal motions and limits the adaptability of these methods to diverse kinematic structures. We propose a comprehensive motion generation method that explicitly incorporates closed-loop kinematics and their associated constraints in an optimal control problem, integrating kinematic closure conditions and their analytical derivatives. This allows the solver to leverage the non-linear transmission effects inherent to closed-chain mechanisms, reducing peak actuator efforts and expanding their effective operating range. Unlike previous methods, our framework does not require serial approximations, enabling more accurate and efficient motion strategies. We also are able to generate the motion of more complex robots for which an approximate serial chain does not exist. We validate our approach through simulations and experiments, demonstrating superior performance in complex tasks such as rapid locomotion and stair negotiation. This method enhances the capabilities of current closed-loop robots and broadens the design space for future kinematic architectures. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 具有闭环 kinematic 链的腿式机器人由于其增强的移动性和效率而日益普遍。然而，大多数运动生成方法依赖于串联链近似，绕过了它们特有的约束和动力学。这导致了次优运动，并限制了这些方法对多样化 kinematic 结构的适应性。我们提出了一种全面的运动生成方法，该方法在最优控制问题中明确地纳入了闭环 kinematic 链及其相关的约束条件，结合了 kinematic 闭合条件及其分析导数。这使求解器能够利用闭环机制固有的非线性传递效应，降低峰值执行器努力并扩大其有效操作范围。与先前的方法不同，我们的框架不需要串联近似，从而能够生成更准确和高效的运动策略。我们还能够为其中并不存在近似串联链的更复杂机器人生成运动。我们通过仿真和实验验证了我们的方法，在复杂的任务如快速运动和楼梯导航中表现出优越性能。此方法增强了当前闭环机器人的能力，并为未来的 kinematic 架构设计空间开辟了新的可能性。

**Title (ZH)**: 基于混合现实的手绘地图编辑界面 for 移动机器人导航 

**Authors**: Takumi Taki, Masato Kobayashi, Eduardo Iglesius, Naoya Chiba, Shizuka Shirai, Yuki Uranishi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00580)  

**Abstract**: Mobile robot navigation systems are increasingly relied upon in dynamic and complex environments, yet they often struggle with map inaccuracies and the resulting inefficient path planning. This paper presents MRHaD, a Mixed Reality-based Hand-drawn Map Editing Interface that enables intuitive, real-time map modifications through natural hand gestures. By integrating the MR head-mounted display with the robotic navigation system, operators can directly create hand-drawn restricted zones (HRZ), thereby bridging the gap between 2D map representations and the real-world environment. Comparative experiments against conventional 2D editing methods demonstrate that MRHaD significantly improves editing efficiency, map accuracy, and overall usability, contributing to safer and more efficient mobile robot operations. The proposed approach provides a robust technical foundation for advancing human-robot collaboration and establishing innovative interaction models that enhance the hybrid future of robotics and human society.

# Robust LiDAR-Camera Calibration with 2D Gaussian Splatting 

**Title (ZH)**: 鲁棒的 LiDAR-相机标定方法：基于2D高斯点云投影 

**Authors**: Shuyi Zhou, Shuxiang Xie, Ryoichi Ishikawa, Takeshi Oishi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00525)  

**Abstract**: LiDAR-camera systems have become increasingly popular in robotics recently. A critical and initial step in integrating the LiDAR and camera data is the calibration of the LiDAR-camera system. Most existing calibration methods rely on auxiliary target objects, which often involve complex manual operations, whereas targetless methods have yet to achieve practical effectiveness. Recognizing that 2D Gaussian Splatting (2DGS) can reconstruct geometric information from camera image sequences, we propose a calibration method that estimates LiDAR-camera extrinsic parameters using geometric constraints. The proposed method begins by reconstructing colorless 2DGS using LiDAR point clouds. Subsequently, we update the colors of the Gaussian splats by minimizing the photometric loss. The extrinsic parameters are optimized during this process. Additionally, we address the limitations of the photometric loss by incorporating the reprojection and triangulation losses, thereby enhancing the calibration robustness and accuracy.

# Indoor Drone Localization and Tracking Based on Acoustic Inertial Measurement 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于声学惯性测量的室内无人机定位与跟踪 

**Authors**: Yimiao Sun, Weiguo Wang, Luca Mottola, Zhang Jia, Ruijin Wang, Yuan He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00445)  

**Abstract**: We present Acoustic Inertial Measurement (AIM), a one-of-a-kind technique for indoor drone localization and tracking. Indoor drone localization and tracking are arguably a crucial, yet unsolved challenge: in GPS-denied environments, existing approaches enjoy limited applicability, especially in Non-Line of Sight (NLoS), require extensive environment instrumentation, or demand considerable hardware/software changes on drones. In contrast, AIM exploits the acoustic characteristics of the drones to estimate their location and derive their motion, even in NLoS settings. We tame location estimation errors using a dedicated Kalman filter and the Interquartile Range rule (IQR) and demonstrate that AIM can support indoor spaces with arbitrary ranges and layouts. We implement AIM using an off-the-shelf microphone array and evaluate its performance with a commercial drone under varied settings. Results indicate that the mean localization error of AIM is 46% lower than that of commercial UWB-based systems in a complex 10m\times10m indoor scenario, where state-of-the-art infrared systems would not even work because of NLoS situations. When distributed microphone arrays are deployed, the mean error can be reduced to less than 0.5m in a 20m range, and even support spaces with arbitrary ranges and layouts.

# Control Barrier Functions via Minkowski Operations for Safe Navigation among Polytopic Sets 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于Minkowski运算法则的多面体集安全导航的控制屏障函数方法 

**Authors**: Yi-Hsuan Chen, Shuo Liu, Wei Xiao, Calin Belta, Michael Otte  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00364)  

**Abstract**: Safely navigating around obstacles while respecting the dynamics, control, and geometry of the underlying system is a key challenge in robotics. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) generate safe control policies by considering system dynamics and geometry when calculating safe forward-invariant sets. Existing CBF-based methods often rely on conservative shape approximations, like spheres or ellipsoids, which have explicit and differentiable distance functions. In this paper, we propose an optimization-defined CBF that directly considers the exact Signed Distance Function (SDF) between a polytopic robot and polytopic obstacles. Inspired by the Gilbert-Johnson-Keerthi (GJK) algorithm, we formulate both (i) minimum distance and (ii) penetration depth between polytopic sets as convex optimization problems in the space of Minkowski difference operations (the MD-space). Convenient geometric properties of the MD-space enable the derivatives of implicit SDF between two polytopes to be computed via differentiable optimization. We demonstrate the proposed framework in three scenarios including pure translation, initialization inside an unsafe set, and multi-obstacle avoidance. These three scenarios highlight the generation of a non-conservative maneuver, a recovery after starting in collision, and the consideration of multiple obstacles via pairwise CBF constraint, respectively.

# An Iterative Algorithm to Symbolically Derive Generalized n-Trailer Vehicle Kinematics 

**Title (ZH)**: 一种迭代算法用于符号推导n trailer车辆广义运动学 

**Authors**: Yuvraj Singh, Adithya Jayakumar, Giorgio Rizzoni  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00315)  

**Abstract**: Articulated multi-axle vehicles are interesting from a control-theoretic perspective due to their peculiar kinematic offtracking characteristics, instability modes, and singularities. Holonomic and nonholonomic constraints affecting the kinematic behavior is investigated in order to develop control-oriented kinematic models representative of these peculiarities. Then, the structure of these constraints is exploited to develop an iterative algorithm to symbolically derive yaw-plane kinematic models of generalized $n$-trailer articulated vehicles with an arbitrary number of multi-axle vehicle units. A formal proof is provided for the maximum number of kinematic controls admissible to a large-scale generalized articulated vehicle system, which leads to a generalized Ackermann steering law for $n$-trailer systems. Moreover, kinematic data collected from a test vehicle is used to validate the kinematic models and, to understand the rearward yaw rate amplification behavior of the vehicle pulling multiple simulated trailers.

# Co-design Optimization of Moving Parts for Compliance and Collision Avoidance 

**Title (ZH)**: 移动部件的协调优化设计以实现柔顺性与碰撞避免 

**Authors**: Amir M. Mirzendehdel, Morad Behandish  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00292)  

**Abstract**: Design requirements for moving parts in mechanical assemblies are typically specified in terms of interactions with other parts. Some are purely kinematic (e.g., pairwise collision avoidance) while others depend on physics and material properties (e.g., deformation under loads). Kinematic design methods and physics-based shape/topology optimization (SO/TO) deal separately with these requirements. They rarely talk to each other as the former uses set algebra and group theory while the latter requires discretizing and solving differential equations. Hence, optimizing a moving part based on physics typically relies on either neglecting or pruning kinematic constraints in advance, e.g., by restricting the design domain to a collision-free space using an unsweep operation. In this paper, we show that TO can be used to co-design two or more parts in relative motion to simultaneously satisfy physics-based criteria and collision avoidance. We restrict our attention to maximizing linear-elastic stiffness while penalizing collision measures aggregated in time. We couple the TO loops for two parts in relative motion so that the evolution of each part's shape is accounted for when penalizing collision for the other part. The collision measures are computed by a correlation functional that can be discretized by left- and right-multiplying the shape design variables by a pre-computed matrix that depends solely on the motion. This decoupling is key to making the computations scalable for TO iterations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach with 2D and 3D examples. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 机械装配中移动部件的设计要求通常用与其他部件的互作来指定。一些要求纯粹是机构学上的（如，成对碰撞避免），而另一些则依赖于物理和材料属性（如，在载荷下的变形）。机构学设计方法和基于物理的形状/拓扑优化（SO/TO）分别处理这些需求。前者使用集合代数和群论，后者则需要对微分方程进行离散化和求解。因此，基于物理优化一个移动部件通常要么提前忽略要么修剪机构约束。本文中，我们展示了可以通过同时满足基于物理的要求和碰撞避免来联合设计两个或多个相对运动的部件。我们将注意力集中在最大化线性弹性刚度上，并对时间累积的碰撞措施进行惩罚。我们将两个相对运动部件的优化循环耦合，使得一个部件形状的演变被考虑进去以惩罚另一个部件的碰撞。碰撞措施通过一个相关函数计算，该函数可以通过将形状设计变量左右乘以一个仅依赖于运动的先验计算矩阵来离散化。这种解耦是使计算在TO迭代中可扩展的关键。我们通过2D和3D示例展示了该方法的有效性。

# PneuDrive: An Embedded Pressure Control System and Modeling Toolkit for Large-Scale Soft Robots 

**Title (ZH)**: PneuDrive：一种用于大规模软机器人嵌入式压力控制系统及建模工具包 

**Authors**: Curtis C. Johnson, Daniel G. Cheney, Dallin L. Cordon, Marc D. Killpack  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00222)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we present a modular pressure control system called PneuDrive that can be used for large-scale, pneumatically-actuated soft robots. The design is particularly suited for situations which require distributed pressure control and high flow rates. Up to four embedded pressure control modules can be daisy-chained together as peripherals on a robust RS-485 bus, enabling closed-loop control of up to 16 valves with pressures ranging from 0-100 psig (0-689 kPa) over distances of more than 10 meters. The system is configured as a C++ ROS node by default. However, independent of ROS, we provide a Python interface with a scripting API for added flexibility. We demonstrate our implementation of PneuDrive through various trajectory tracking experiments for a three-joint, continuum soft robot with 12 different pressure inputs. Finally, we present a modeling toolkit with implementations of three dynamic actuation models, all suitable for real-time simulation and control. We demonstrate the use of this toolkit in customizing each model with real-world data and evaluating the performance of each model. The results serve as a reference guide for choosing between several actuation models in a principled manner. A video summarizing our results can be found here: this https URL.

# Interpreting and Improving Optimal Control Problems with Directional Corrections 

**Title (ZH)**: 解析并改进具有方向修正的最优控制问题 

**Authors**: Trevor Barron, Xiaojing Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00415)  

**Abstract**: Many robotics tasks, such as path planning or trajectory optimization, are formulated as optimal control problems (OCPs). The key to obtaining high performance lies in the design of the OCP's objective function. In practice, the objective function consists of a set of individual components that must be carefully modeled and traded off such that the OCP has the desired solution. It is often challenging to balance multiple components to achieve the desired solution and to understand, when the solution is undesired, the impact of individual cost components. In this paper, we present a framework addressing these challenges based on the concept of directional corrections. Specifically, given the solution to an OCP that is deemed undesirable, and access to an expert providing the direction of change that would increase the desirability of the solution, our method analyzes the individual cost components for their "consistency" with the provided directional correction. This information can be used to improve the OCP formulation, e.g., by increasing the weight of consistent cost components, or reducing the weight of - or even redesigning - inconsistent cost components. We also show that our framework can automatically tune parameters of the OCP to achieve consistency with a set of corrections.

**Title (ZH)**: 骨架化质量评价：机器人领域点云分析的几何度量 

**Authors**: Qingmeng Wen, Yu-Kun Lai, Ze Ji, Seyed Amir Tafrishi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.00032)  

**Abstract**: Skeletonization is a powerful tool for shape analysis, rooted in the inherent instinct to understand an object's morphology. It has found applications across various domains, including robotics. Although skeletonization algorithms have been studied in recent years, their performance is rarely quantified with detailed numerical evaluations. This work focuses on defining and quantifying geometric properties to systematically score the skeletonization results of point cloud shapes across multiple aspects, including topological similarity, boundedness, centeredness, and smoothness. We introduce these representative metric definitions along with a numerical scoring framework to analyze skeletonization outcomes concerning point cloud data for different scenarios, from object manipulation to mobile robot navigation. Additionally, we provide an open-source tool to enable the research community to evaluate and refine their skeleton models. Finally, we assess the performance and sensitivity of the proposed geometric evaluation methods from various robotic applications.
