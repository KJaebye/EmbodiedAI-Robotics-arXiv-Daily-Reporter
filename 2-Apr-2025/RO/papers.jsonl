Current methods improve VIO by incorporating a model of the translational vehicle dynamics, yet their performance degrades when faced with low-accuracy vehicle models or continuous external disturbances, like wind. Additionally, incorporating rotational dynamics in these models is computationally intractable when they are deployed in online applications, e.g., in a closed-loop control system. We present HDVIO2.0, which models full 6-DoF, translational and rotational, vehicle dynamics and tightly incorporates them into a VIO with minimal impact on the runtime. HDVIO2.0 builds upon the previous work, HDVIO, and addresses these challenges through a hybrid dynamics model combining a point-mass vehicle model with a learning-based component, with access to control commands and IMU history, to capture complex aerodynamic effects. The key idea behind modeling the rotational dynamics is to represent them with continuous-time functions. HDVIO2.0 leverages the divergence between the actual motion and the predicted motion from the hybrid dynamics model to estimate external forces as well as the robot state. Our system surpasses the performance of state-of-the-art methods in experiments using public and new drone dynamics datasets, as well as real-world flights in winds up to 25 km/h. Unlike existing approaches, we also show that accurate vehicle dynamics predictions are achievable without precise knowledge of the full vehicle state.', 'abstract_zh': '基于视觉-惯性里程计的全6自由度动力学模型（HDVIO2.0）', 'title_zh': 'HDVIO2.0: 基于混合动力学VIO的风速与干扰估计'}

Such approach rely on large models, without sufficient understanding of the environment.

This study builds on this and examines the human ability to localize consequential sounds of three robots (quadruped Go1, wheeled Turtlebot 2i, wheeled HSR) in Virtual Reality. In a within-subjects design, we assessed participants' localization performance for the robots with and without an acoustic vehicle alerting system (AVAS) for two velocities (0.3, 0.8 m/s) and two trajectories (head-on, radial).

Localization errors were measured as the absolute angular difference between the participants' estimated and the actual robot position. Results showed that the robot type significantly influenced the localization accuracy and precision, with the sound of the wheeled HSR (especially without AVAS) performing worst under all experimental conditions. Surprisingly, participants rated the HSR sound as more positive, less annoying, and more trustworthy than the Turtlebot and Go1 sound.

To address this issue, we propose a novel CP-based navigation framework that responds exclusively to safety-critical prediction errors. Our approach introduces egocentric score functions that quantify how much closer obstacles are to a candidate vehicle position than anticipated. These score functions are then integrated into a model predictive control scheme, wherein each candidate state is individually evaluated for safety. Combined with an adaptive CP mechanism, our framework dynamically adjusts to changes in obstacle motion without resorting to unnecessary conservatism. Theoretical analyses indicate that our method outperforms existing CP-based approaches in terms of cost-efficiency while maintaining the desired safety levels, as further validated through experiments on real-world datasets featuring densely populated pedestrian environments.', 'abstract_zh': '面向安全关键预测误差的配准预测导航框架', 'title_zh': '基于自我中心可信预测的动态杂乱环境中安全高效导航'}

Indoor drone localization and tracking are arguably a crucial, yet unsolved challenge: in GPS-denied environments, existing approaches enjoy limited applicability, especially in Non-Line of Sight (NLoS), require extensive environment instrumentation, or demand considerable hardware/software changes on drones. In contrast, AIM exploits the acoustic characteristics of the drones to estimate their location and derive their motion, even in NLoS settings. We tame location estimation errors using a dedicated Kalman filter and the Interquartile Range rule (IQR) and demonstrate that AIM can support indoor spaces with arbitrary ranges and layouts. We implement AIM using an off-the-shelf microphone array and evaluate its performance with a commercial drone under varied settings. Results indicate that the mean localization error of AIM is 46% lower than that of commercial UWB-based systems in a complex 10m\\times10m indoor scenario, where state-of-the-art infrared systems would not even work because of NLoS situations.

Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) generate safe control policies by considering system dynamics and geometry when calculating safe forward-invariant sets.

In this paper, we propose an optimization-defined CBF that directly considers the exact Signed Distance Function (SDF) between a polytopic robot and polytopic obstacles.

Convenient geometric properties of the MD-space enable the derivatives of implicit SDF between two polytopes to be computed via differentiable optimization.

Furthermore, by statistically analyzing how constraint violations evolve throughout the diffusion steps, we develop a re-weighting strategy that aligns predicted violations to ground truth statistics at each diffusion step.

Some are purely kinematic (e.g., pairwise collision avoidance) while others depend on physics and material properties (e.g., deformation under loads). Kinematic design methods and physics-based shape/topology optimization (SO/TO) deal separately with these requirements. They rarely talk to each other as the former uses set algebra and group theory while the latter requires discretizing and solving differential equations. Hence, optimizing a moving part based on physics typically relies on either neglecting or pruning kinematic constraints in advance, e.g., by restricting the design domain to a collision-free space using an unsweep operation. In this paper, we show that TO can be used to co-design two or more parts in relative motion to simultaneously satisfy physics-based criteria and collision avoidance. We restrict our attention to maximizing linear-elastic stiffness while penalizing collision measures aggregated in time. We couple the TO loops for two parts in relative motion so that the evolution of each part's shape is accounted for when penalizing collision for the other part. The collision measures are computed by a correlation functional that can be discretized by left- and right-multiplying the shape design variables by a pre-computed matrix that depends solely on the motion.

It is often challenging to balance multiple components to achieve the desired solution and to understand, when the solution is undesired, the impact of individual cost components. In this paper, we present a framework addressing these challenges based on the concept of directional corrections. Specifically, given the solution to an OCP that is deemed undesirable, and access to an expert providing the direction of change that would increase the desirability of the solution, our method analyzes the individual cost components for their "consistency" with the provided directional correction. This information can be used to improve the OCP formulation, e.g., by increasing the weight of consistent cost components, or reducing the weight of - or even redesigning - inconsistent cost components.
