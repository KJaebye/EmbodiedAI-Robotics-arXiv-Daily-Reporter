**Authors**: Julien Mellet, Fabio Ruggiero, Vincenzo Lippiello  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17362)  

**Abstract**: Humans process significantly more information through the sense of touch than through vision. Consequently, haptics for telemanipulation is poised to become essential in the coming years, as it offers operators an additional sensory channel crucial for interpretation in extreme conditions. However, current haptic device setups are either difficult to access or provide low-quality force feedback rendering. This work proposes the design of a single-axis, open-source setup for telemanipulation development, aimed at addressing these issues. We first introduce the haptic device and demonstrate its integration with common robotic tools. The proposed joystick has the potential to accelerate the development and deployment of haptic technology in a wide range of robotics applications, enhancing operator feedback and control.

**Title (ZH)**: 初始滑动时空特征检测的建模、仿真与应用 

**Authors**: Mingxuan Li, Lunwei Zhang, Qiyin Huang, Tiemin Li, Yao Jiang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17335)  

**Abstract**: Incipient slip detection provides critical feedback for robotic grasping and manipulation tasks. However, maintaining its adaptability under diverse object properties and complex working conditions remains challenging. This article highlights the importance of completely representing spatio-temporal features of slip, and proposes a novel approach for incipient slip modeling and detection. Based on the analysis of localized displacement phenomenon, we establish the relationship between the characteristic strain rate extreme events and the local slip state. This approach enables the detection of both the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of stick-slip regions. Also, the proposed method can be applied to strain distribution sensing devices, such as vision-based tactile sensors. Simulations and prototype experiments validated the effectiveness of this approach under varying contact conditions, including different contact geometries, friction coefficients, and combined loads. Experiments demonstrated that this method not only accurately and reliably delineates incipient slip, but also facilitates friction parameter estimation and adaptive grasping control. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 初始滑移检测为机器人抓取和操作任务提供关键反馈。然而，在多样化的物体属性和复杂的工况条件下保持其适应性仍然具有挑战性。本文强调了完全表示滑移的空时特征的重要性，并提出了一种新的初始滑移建模和检测方法。基于局部位移现象的分析，我们建立了特征应变率极端事件与局部滑移状态之间的关系。该方法能够检测粘滑区域的空间分布和时间动态。此外，所提出的方法可以应用于应变分布传感设备，如基于视觉的触觉传感器。仿真和原型实验验证了该方法在不同接触条件下的有效性，包括不同的接触几何形状、摩擦系数和载荷组合。实验表明，该方法不仅能准确可靠地检测初始滑移，还能促进摩擦参数估计和自适应抓取控制。

# Inverse Kinematics on Guiding Vector Fields for Robot Path Following 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于引导向量场的逆 kinematics 机器人路径跟踪 

**Authors**: Yu Zhou, Jesús Bautista, Weijia Yao, Héctor García de Marina  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17313)  

**Abstract**: Inverse kinematics is a fundamental technique for motion and positioning control in robotics, typically applied to end-effectors. In this paper, we extend the concept of inverse kinematics to guiding vector fields for path following in autonomous mobile robots. The desired path is defined by its implicit equation, i.e., by a collection of points belonging to one or more zero-level sets. These level sets serve as a reference to construct an error signal that drives the guiding vector field toward the desired path, enabling the robot to converge and travel along the path by following such a vector field. We start with the formal exposition on how inverse kinematics can be applied to guiding vector fields for single-integrator robots in an m-dimensional Euclidean space. Then, we leverage inverse kinematics to ensure that the level-set error signal behaves as a linear system, facilitating control over the robot's transient motion toward the desired path and allowing for the injection of feed-forward signals to induce precise motion behavior along the path. We then propose solutions to the theoretical and practical challenges of applying this technique to unicycles with constant speeds to follow 2D paths with precise transient control. We finish by validating the predicted theoretical results through real flights with fixed-wing drones.

# Hybrid Human-Machine Perception via Adaptive LiDAR for Advanced Driver Assistance Systems 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于自适应激光雷达的混合人机感知技术应用于高级驾驶辅助系统 

**Authors**: Federico Scarì, Nitin Jonathan Myers, Chen Quan, Arkady Zgonnikov  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17309)  

**Abstract**: Accurate environmental perception is critical for advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS). Light detection and ranging (LiDAR) systems play a crucial role in ADAS; they can reliably detect obstacles and help ensure traffic safety. Existing research on LiDAR sensing has demonstrated that adapting the LiDAR's resolution and range based on environmental characteristics can improve machine perception. However, current adaptive LiDAR approaches for ADAS have not explored the possibility of combining the perception abilities of the vehicle and the human driver, which can potentially further enhance the detection performance. In this paper, we propose a novel system that adapts LiDAR characteristics to human driver's visual perception to enhance LiDAR sensing outside human's field of view. We develop a proof-of-concept prototype of the system in the virtual environment CARLA. Our system integrates real-time data on the driver's gaze to identify regions in the environment that the driver is monitoring. This allows the system to optimize LiDAR resources by dynamically increasing the LiDAR's range and resolution in peripheral areas that the driver may not be attending to. Our simulations show that this gaze-aware LiDAR enhances detection performance compared to a baseline standalone LiDAR, particularly in challenging environmental conditions like fog. Our hybrid human-machine sensing approach potentially offers improved safety and situational awareness in real-time driving scenarios for ADAS applications. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 准确的环境感知对于高级驾驶辅助系统（ADAS）至关重要。激光检测与测距（LiDAR）系统在ADAS中扮演着关键角色；它们可以可靠地检测障碍物并有助于保障交通安全性。现有LiDAR感知研究已证明，根据环境特性调整LiDAR的分辨率和探测范围可以提高机器感知性能。然而，目前针对ADAS的自适应LiDAR方法尚未探索将车辆感知能力和人类驾驶员感知能力结合的可能性，这可能是进一步提升检测性能的关键。在本文中，我们提出了一种新型系统，通过适应人类驾驶员的视觉感知来优化LiDAR在驾驶员视野之外区域的感知特性。我们利用CARLA虚拟环境开发了该系统的概念验证原型。该系统整合了驾驶员注视的实时数据，以识别驾驶员正在监控的环境区域。这使得系统能够通过动态增加周边区域的LiDAR探测范围和分辨率来优化LiDAR资源。我们的仿真实验表明，这种基于注视的LiDAR相较于基准独立LiDAR，在雾等具有挑战性的环境条件下，能显著提高检测性能。我们的人机混合感知方法可能在ADAS应用场景中提供更好的实时驾驶安全性与态势感知。

# CAR-LOAM: Color-Assisted Robust LiDAR Odometry and Mapping 

**Title (ZH)**: CAR-LOAM: 颜色辅助鲁棒lidar里程计与建图 

**Authors**: Yufei Lu, Yuetao Li, Zhizhou Jia, Qun Hao, Shaohui Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17249)  

**Abstract**: In this letter, we propose a color-assisted robust framework for accurate LiDAR odometry and mapping (LOAM). Simultaneously receiving data from both the LiDAR and the camera, the framework utilizes the color information from the camera images to colorize the LiDAR point clouds and then performs iterative pose optimization. For each LiDAR scan, the edge and planar features are extracted and colored using the corresponding image and then matched to a global map. Specifically, we adopt a perceptually uniform color difference weighting strategy to exclude color correspondence outliers and a robust error metric based on the Welsch's function to mitigate the impact of positional correspondence outliers during the pose optimization process. As a result, the system achieves accurate localization and reconstructs dense, accurate, colored and three-dimensional (3D) maps of the environment. Thorough experiments with challenging scenarios, including complex forests and a campus, show that our method provides higher robustness and accuracy compared with current state-of-the-art methods.

**Title (ZH)**: 低成本轻量化6自由度双臂 manipulator 设计，适用于动态和富含接触的操作 

**Authors**: Jaehyung Kim, Jiho Kim, Dongryung Lee, Yujin Jang, Beomjoon Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16908)  

**Abstract**: Dynamic and contact-rich object manipulation, such as striking, snatching, or hammering, remains challenging for robotic systems due to hardware limitations. Most existing robots are constrained by high-inertia design, limited compliance, and reliance on expensive torque sensors. To address this, we introduce ARMADA (Affordable Robot for Manipulation and Dynamic Actions), a 6 degrees-of-freedom bimanual robot designed for dynamic manipulation research. ARMADA combines low-inertia, back-drivable actuators with a lightweight design, using readily available components and 3D-printed links for ease of assembly in research labs. The entire system, including both arms, is built for just $6,100. Each arm achieves speeds up to 6.16m/s, almost twice that of most collaborative robots, with a comparable payload of 2.5kg. We demonstrate ARMADA can perform dynamic manipulation like snatching, hammering, and bimanual throwing in real-world environments. We also showcase its effectiveness in reinforcement learning (RL) by training a non-prehensile manipulation policy in simulation and transferring it zero-shot to the real world, as well as human motion shadowing for dynamic bimanual object throwing. ARMADA is fully open-sourced with detailed assembly instructions, CAD models, URDFs, simulation, and learning codes. We highly recommend viewing the supplementary video at this https URL.

**Title (ZH)**: 增强拉格朗日乘子在机器人多接触仿真中的变体研究 

**Authors**: Jeongmin Lee, Minji Lee, Sunkyung Park, Jinhee Yun, Dongjun Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16898)  

**Abstract**: The multi-contact nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) is a naturally arising challenge in robotic simulations. Achieving high performance in terms of both accuracy and efficiency remains a significant challenge, particularly in scenarios involving intensive contacts and stiff interactions. In this article, we introduce a new class of multi-contact NCP solvers based on the theory of the Augmented Lagrangian (AL). We detail how the standard derivation of AL in convex optimization can be adapted to handle multi-contact NCP through the iteration of surrogate problem solutions and the subsequent update of primal-dual variables. Specifically, we present two tailored variations of AL for robotic simulations: the Cascaded Newton-based Augmented Lagrangian (CANAL) and the Subsystem-based Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (SubADMM). We demonstrate how CANAL can manage multi-contact NCP in an accurate and robust manner, while SubADMM offers superior computational speed, scalability, and parallelizability for high degrees-of-freedom multibody systems with numerous contacts. Our results showcase the effectiveness of the proposed solver framework, illustrating its advantages in various robotic manipulation scenarios. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 多接触非线性互补问题（NCP）是机器人仿真中自然产生的挑战。在精度和效率方面实现高性能仍然是一个重大挑战，特别是在涉及密集接触和刚性交互的场景中。本文介绍了一种基于增广拉格朗日（AL）理论的多接触NCP求解器新类。我们详细阐述了如何通过代理问题解的迭代和原始对偶变量的后续更新，将标准的凸优化中AL的推导适应到多接触NCP的处理中。具体来说，我们为机器人仿真提出了两种定制的AL变体：级联牛顿增广拉格朗日（CANAL）和子系统交替方向乘子法（SubADMM）。我们展示了CANAL如何能够以准确且 robust 的方式处理多接触NCP，而SubADMM则为具有大量接触的多体系统提供了卓越的计算速度、可扩展性和并行化能力。我们的结果展示了所提求解器框架的有效性，突显了其在各种机器人操作场景中的优势。

# Primitive-Swarm: An Ultra-lightweight and Scalable Planner for Large-scale Aerial Swarms 

**Title (ZH)**: 原始群集：一种适用于大规模 aerial 群无人机的超轻量级可扩展规划器 

**Authors**: Jialiang Hou, Xin Zhou, Neng Pan, Ang Li, Yuxiang Guan, Chao Xu, Zhongxue Gan, Fei Gao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16887)  

**Abstract**: Achieving large-scale aerial swarms is challenging due to the inherent contradictions in balancing computational efficiency and scalability. This paper introduces Primitive-Swarm, an ultra-lightweight and scalable planner designed specifically for large-scale autonomous aerial swarms. The proposed approach adopts a decentralized and asynchronous replanning strategy. Within it is a novel motion primitive library consisting of time-optimal and dynamically feasible trajectories. They are generated utlizing a novel time-optimial path parameterization algorithm based on reachability analysis (TOPP-RA). Then, a rapid collision checking mechanism is developed by associating the motion primitives with the discrete surrounding space according to conflicts. By considering both spatial and temporal conflicts, the mechanism handles robot-obstacle and robot-robot collisions simultaneously. Then, during a replanning process, each robot selects the safe and minimum cost trajectory from the library based on user-defined requirements. Both the time-optimal motion primitive library and the occupancy information are computed offline, turning a time-consuming optimization problem into a linear-complexity selection problem. This enables the planner to comprehensively explore the non-convex, discontinuous 3-D safe space filled with numerous obstacles and robots, effectively identifying the best hidden path. Benchmark comparisons demonstrate that our method achieves the shortest flight time and traveled distance with a computation time of less than 1 ms in dense environments. Super large-scale swarm simulations, involving up to 1000 robots, running in real-time, verify the scalability of our method. Real-world experiments validate the feasibility and robustness of our approach. The code will be released to foster community collaboration. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 实现大型空中蜂群挑战重重，因其在计算效率和扩展性之间存在固有的矛盾。本文介绍了一种名为Primitive-Swarm的超轻量级且可扩展的规划器，专门设计用于大型自主空中蜂群。所提出的方法采用去中心化和异步重规划策略。该方法中包含一个新颖的运动基元库，其中包含时间最优且动力学可行的轨迹。这些轨迹利用基于可达性分析的时间最优路径参数化算法（TOPP-RA）生成。通过将运动基元与离散周围空间关联来开发快速碰撞检测机制，根据冲突处理空间和时间冲突。在重规划过程中，每个机器人根据用户定义的要求从基元库中选择安全且成本最低的轨迹。时间最优运动基元库和占用信息在离线阶段计算，将耗时优化问题转化为线性复杂度的选择问题。这使规划器能够全面探索充满众多障碍物和机器人的非凸、不连续3D安全空间，有效识别最佳隐藏路径。基准测试比较表明，我们的方法在密集环境中计算时间少于1毫秒，达到最短飞行时间和最短行程。大规模集群仿真，最多涉及1000个机器人，实时运行，验证了我们方法的可扩展性。现实世界实验验证了我们方法的可行性和鲁棒性。代码将开源以促进社区合作。

# Primitive-Planner: An Ultra Lightweight Quadrotor Planner with Time-optimal Primitives 

**Title (ZH)**: 骨骼规划器：一种基于时间最优基本动作的超轻量级 quadcopter 规划器 

**Authors**: Jialiang Hou, Neng Pan, Zhepei Wang, Jialin Ji, Yuxiang Guan, Zhongxue Gan, Fei Gao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16882)  

**Abstract**: It is a significant requirement for a quadrotor trajectory planner to simultaneously guarantee trajectory quality and system lightweight. Many researchers focus on this problem, but there's still a gap between their performance and our common wish. In this paper, we propose an ultra lightweight quadrotor planner with time-optimal primitives. Firstly, a novel motion primitive library is proposed to generate time-optimal and dynamical feasible trajectories offline. Secondly, we propose a fast collision checking method with a deterministic time consumption, independent of the sampling resolution of the primitives. Finally, we select the minimum cost trajectory to execute among the safe primitives based on user-defined requirements. The propsed transformation relation between the local trajectories ensures the smoothness of the global trajectory. The planner reduces unnecessary online computing power consumption as much as possible, while ensuring a high-quality trajectory. Benchmark comparisons show that our method can generate the shortest flight time and distance of trajectory with the lowest computation overload. Challenging real-world experiments validate the robustness of our method.

**Title (ZH)**: 基于光滑接触梯度的腿式机器人在滑溜地面上的在线摩擦系数识别 

**Authors**: Hajun Kim, Dongyun Kang, Min-Gyu Kim, Gijeong Kim, Hae-Won Park  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16843)  

**Abstract**: This paper proposes an online friction coefficient identification framework for legged robots on slippery terrain. The approach formulates the optimization problem to minimize the sum of residuals between actual and predicted states parameterized by the friction coefficient in rigid body contact dynamics. Notably, the proposed framework leverages the analytic smoothed gradient of contact impulses, obtained by smoothing the complementarity condition of Coulomb friction, to solve the issue of non-informative gradients induced from the nonsmooth contact dynamics. Moreover, we introduce the rejection method to filter out data with high normal contact velocity following contact initiations during friction coefficient identification for legged robots. To validate the proposed framework, we conduct the experiments using a quadrupedal robot platform, KAIST HOUND, on slippery and nonslippery terrain. We observe that our framework achieves fast and consistent friction coefficient identification within various initial conditions.

**Abstract**: Autonomously controlling the position of Remotely Operated underwater Vehicles (ROVs) is of crucial importance for a wide range of underwater engineering applications, such as in the inspection and maintenance of underwater industrial structures. Consequently, studying vision-based underwater robot navigation and control has recently gained increasing attention to counter the numerous challenges faced in underwater conditions, such as lighting variability, turbidity, camera image distortions (due to bubbles), and ROV positional disturbances (due to underwater currents). In this paper, we propose (to the best of our knowledge) a first rigorous unified benchmarking of more than seven Machine Learning (ML)-based one-shot object tracking algorithms for vision-based position locking of ROV platforms. We propose a position-locking system that processes images of an object of interest in front of which the ROV must be kept stable. Then, our proposed system uses the output result of different object tracking algorithms to automatically correct the position of the ROV against external disturbances. We conducted numerous real-world experiments using a BlueROV2 platform within an indoor pool and provided clear demonstrations of the strengths and weaknesses of each tracking approach. Finally, to help alleviate the scarcity of underwater ROV data, we release our acquired data base as open-source with the hope of benefiting future research.

# On Enhancing Structural Resilience of Multirobot Coverage Control with Bearing Rigidity 

**Title (ZH)**: 增强多机器人覆盖控制的结构韧性和轴承刚性性能 

**Authors**: Kartik A. Pant, Vishnu Vijay, Minhyun Cho, Inseok Hwang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16460)  

**Abstract**: The problem of multi-robot coverage control has been widely studied to efficiently coordinate a team of robots to cover a desired area of interest. However, this problem faces significant challenges when some robots are lost or deviate from their desired formation during the mission due to faults or cyberattacks. Since a majority of multi-robot systems (MRSs) rely on communication and relative sensing for their efficient operation, a failure in one robot could result in a cascade of failures in the entire system. In this work, we propose a hierarchical framework for area coverage, combining centralized coordination by leveraging Voronoi partitioning with decentralized reference tracking model predictive control (MPC) for control design. In addition to reference tracking, the decentralized MPC also performs bearing maintenance to enforce a rigid MRS network, thereby enhancing the structural resilience, i.e., the ability to detect and mitigate the effects of localization errors and robot loss during the mission. Furthermore, we show that the resulting control architecture guarantees the recovery of the MRS network in the event of robot loss while maintaining a minimally rigid structure. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithm is validated through numerical simulations. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 多机器人覆盖控制问题在某些机器人因故障或网络攻击而丢失或偏离预定队形时面临着重大挑战。鉴于大多数多机器人系统依赖于通信和相对感知以实现高效运行，一个机器人的故障可能会导致整个系统的连锁反应。本文提出了一种分层框架，结合基于Voronoi分区的集中协调和基于分散参考跟踪模型预测控制（MPC）的控制设计。除了参考跟踪，分散MPC还执行方位保持以确保刚性MRS网络，从而增强结构韧性，即在任务期间检测和缓解定位误差和机器人丢失影响的能力。此外，我们证明了所提出的设计架构能够保证在机器人丢失情况下MRS网络的恢复，同时保持最小刚性结构。所提出算法的有效性通过数值模拟进行了验证。

# Probabilistic Bubble Roadmap 

**Title (ZH)**: 概率气泡路网 

**Authors**: Bernhard Wullt, Mikael Norrlöf, Per Mattsson, Thomas B. Schön  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16205)  

**Abstract**: Finding a collision-free path is a fundamental problem in robotics, where the sampling based planners have a long line of success. However, this approach is computationally expensive, due to the frequent use of collision-detection. Furthermore, the produced paths are usually jagged and require further post-processing before they can be tracked. Due to their high computational cost, these planners are usually restricted to static settings, since they are not able to cope with rapid changes in the environment. In our work, we remove this restriction by introducing a learned signed distance function expressed in the configuration space of the robot. The signed distance allows us to form collision-free spherical regions in the configuration space, which we use to suggest a new multi-query path planner that also works in dynamic settings. We propose the probabilistic bubble roadmap planner, which enhances the probabilistic roadmap planner (PRM) by using spheres as vertices and compute the edges by checking for neighboring spheres which intersect. We benchmark our approach in a static setting where we show that we can produce paths that are shorter than the paths produced by the PRM, while having a smaller sized roadmap and finding the paths faster. Finally, we show that we can rapidly rewire the graph in the case of new obstacles introduced at run time and therefore produce paths in the case of moving obstacles.

# Motion-Coupled Mapping Algorithm for Hybrid Rice Canopy 

**Title (ZH)**: 杂交水稻冠层运动耦合建模算法 

**Authors**: Huaiqu Feng, Guoyang Zhao, Cheng Liu, Yongwei Wang, Jun Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16134)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a motion-coupled mapping algorithm for contour mapping of hybrid rice canopies, specifically designed for Agricultural Unmanned Ground Vehicles (Agri-UGV) navigating complex and unknown rice fields. Precise canopy mapping is essential for Agri-UGVs to plan efficient routes and avoid protected zones. The motion control of Agri-UGVs, tasked with impurity removal and other operations, depends heavily on accurate estimation of rice canopy height and structure. To achieve this, the proposed algorithm integrates real-time RGB-D sensor data with kinematic and inertial measurements, enabling efficient mapping and proprioceptive localization. The algorithm produces grid-based elevation maps that reflect the probabilistic distribution of canopy contours, accounting for motion-induced uncertainties. It is implemented on a high-clearance Agri-UGV platform and tested in various environments, including both controlled and dynamic rice field settings. This approach significantly enhances the mapping accuracy and operational reliability of Agri-UGVs, contributing to more efficient autonomous agricultural operations.

**Title (ZH)**: UAV搜索与探测系统在实际荒野环境中的实验验证 

**Authors**: Stella Dumenčić, Luka Lanča, Karlo Jakac, Stefan Ivić  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.17372)  

**Abstract**: Search and rescue (SAR) missions require reliable search methods to locate survivors, especially in challenging or inaccessible environments. This is why introducing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be of great help to enhance the efficiency of SAR missions while simultaneously increasing the safety of everyone involved in the mission. Motivated by this, we design and experiment with autonomous UAV search for humans in a Mediterranean karst environment. The UAVs are directed using Heat equation-driven area coverage (HEDAC) ergodic control method according to known probability density and detection function. The implemented sensing framework consists of a probabilistic search model, motion control system, and computer vision object detection. It enables calculation of the probability of the target being detected in the SAR mission, and this paper focuses on experimental validation of proposed probabilistic framework and UAV control. The uniform probability density to ensure the even probability of finding the targets in the desired search area is achieved by assigning suitably thought-out tasks to 78 volunteers. The detection model is based on YOLO and trained with a previously collected ortho-photo image database. The experimental search is carefully planned and conducted, while as many parameters as possible are recorded. The thorough analysis consists of the motion control system, object detection, and the search validation. The assessment of the detection and search performance provides strong indication that the designed detection model in the UAV control algorithm is aligned with real-world results.

# Fast Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for Chattering-Free Trajectory Tracking of Robotic Manipulators 

**Title (ZH)**: 无颤振轨迹跟踪的快速有限时间滑模控制 

**Authors**: Momammad Ali Ranjbar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16867)  

**Abstract**: Achieving precise and efficient trajectory tracking in robotic arms remains a key challenge due to system uncertainties and chattering effects in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.

# Optimization-free Smooth Control Barrier Function for Polygonal Collision Avoidance 

**Title (ZH)**: 无优化的平滑控制 barrier 函数应用于多边形碰撞避免 

**Authors**: Shizhen Wu, Yongchun Fang, Ning Sun, Biao Lu, Xiao Liang, Yiming Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.16293)  

**Abstract**: Polygonal collision avoidance (PCA) is short for the problem of collision avoidance between two polygons (i.e., polytopes in planar) that own their dynamic equations. This problem suffers the inherent difficulty in dealing with non-smooth boundaries and recently optimization-defined metrics, such as signed distance field (SDF) and its variants, have been proposed as control barrier functions (CBFs) to tackle PCA problems. In contrast, we propose an optimization-free smooth CBF method in this paper, which is computationally efficient and proved to be nonconservative. It is achieved by three main steps: a lower bound of SDF is expressed as a nested Boolean logic composition first, then its smooth approximation is established by applying the latest log-sum-exp method, after which a specified CBF-based safety filter is proposed to address this class of problems. To illustrate its wide applications, the optimization-free smooth CBF method is extended to solve distributed collision avoidance of two underactuated nonholonomic vehicles and drive an underactuated container crane to avoid a moving obstacle respectively, for which numerical simulations are also performed. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 多边形碰撞避免（PCA）是指在平面中两个具有动力学方程的多边形（即多面体）之间的碰撞避免问题。该问题难以处理非光滑边界和最近提出的基于优化的度量标准（如符号距离场SDF及其变体），这些度量标准作为控制障碍函数（CBFs）用于解决PCA问题。相比之下，本文提出了一种无优化的光滑CBF方法，该方法计算效率高并且证明为非保守。该方法通过三个主要步骤实现：首先将SDF的下界表示为嵌套的布尔逻辑复合，然后通过应用最新的log-sum-exp方法建立其光滑近似，最后提出一种特定的基于CBF的安全过滤器来解决这类问题。为了展示其广泛的应用，无优化的光滑CBF方法被扩展用于解决两辆欠驱动非完整车辆的分布式碰撞避免问题，并使欠驱动集装箱起重机避开移动障碍物，同时进行了数值仿真。

# Getting SMARTER for Motion Planning in Autonomous Driving Systems 

**Title (ZH)**: 为自主驾驶系统中的运动规划变聪明 

**Authors**: Montgomery Alban, Ehsan Ahmadi, Randy Goebel, Amir Rasouli  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15824)  

**Abstract**: Motion planning is a fundamental problem in autonomous driving and perhaps the most challenging to comprehensively evaluate because of the associated risks and expenses of real-world deployment. Therefore, simulations play an important role in efficient development of planning algorithms. To be effective, simulations must be accurate and realistic, both in terms of dynamics and behavior modeling, and also highly customizable in order to accommodate a broad spectrum of research frameworks. In this paper, we introduce SMARTS 2.0, the second generation of our motion planning simulator which, in addition to being highly optimized for large-scale simulation, provides many new features, such as realistic map integration, vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communication, traffic and pedestrian simulation, and a broad variety of sensor models.
Moreover, we present a novel benchmark suite for evaluating planning algorithms in various highly challenging scenarios, including interactive driving, such as turning at intersections, and adaptive driving, in which the task is to closely follow a lead vehicle without any explicit knowledge of its intention. Each scenario is characterized by a variety of traffic patterns and road structures. We further propose a series of common and task-specific metrics to effectively evaluate the performance of the planning algorithms. At the end, we evaluate common motion planning algorithms using the proposed benchmark and highlight the challenges the proposed scenarios impose. The new SMARTS 2.0 features and the benchmark are publicly available at this http URL.
