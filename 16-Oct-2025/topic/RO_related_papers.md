**Abstract**: Although digital fabrication processes at the desktop scale have become proficient and prolific, systems aimed at producing larger-scale structures are still typically complex, expensive, and unreliable. In this work, we present an approach for the fabrication of scalable macroscale structures using simple robots and interlocking lattice building blocks. A target structure is first voxelized so that it can be populated with an architected lattice. These voxels are then grouped into larger interconnected blocks, which are produced using standard digital fabrication processes, leveraging their capability to produce highly complex geometries at a small scale. These blocks, on the size scale of tens of centimeters, are then fed to mobile relative robots that are able to traverse over the structure and place new blocks to form structures on the meter scale. To facilitate the assembly of large structures, we introduce a live digital twin simulation tool for controlling and coordinating assembly robots that enables both global planning for a target structure and live user design, interaction, or intervention. To improve assembly throughput, we introduce a new modular assembly robot, designed for hierarchical voxel handling. We validate this system by demonstrating the voxelization, hierarchical blocking, path planning, and robotic fabrication of a set of meter-scale objects. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 虽然桌面规模的数字化制造进程已经变得熟练且高效，针对更大规模结构的制造系统仍然通常比较复杂、昂贵且不可靠。在本文中，我们提出了一种使用简单机器人和嵌锁 lattice 建筑块来制造可扩展的宏观结构的方法。首先，目标结构被体素化，以便能够填充一种结构化的 lattice。接着，这些体素被分组为更大且相连的块，这些块通过标准化的数字化制造过程生产，利用其在小尺度上生产高度复杂几何形状的能力。这些尺寸为几十厘米的块被提供给能够跨越结构并在其上放置新块以形成数米规模结构的移动相对机器人。为了便于大型结构的组装，我们引入了一种实时数字孪生仿真工具，用于控制和协调装配机器人，既支持全局性的目标结构规划，也支持实时的设计、交互或干预。为了提高装配效率，我们引入了一种新的模块化装配机器人，设计用于分层体素处理。我们通过示范一系列数米规模的对象的体素化、分层块化、路径规划和机器人制造来验证该系统。

**Abstract**: Drone technology is proliferating in many industries, including agriculture, logistics, defense, infrastructure, and environmental monitoring. Vision-based autonomy is one of its key enablers, particularly for real-world applications. This is essential for operating in novel, unstructured environments where traditional navigation methods may be unavailable. Autonomous drone racing has become the de facto benchmark for such systems. State-of-the-art research has shown that autonomous systems can surpass human-level performance in racing arenas. However, direct applicability to commercial and field operations is still limited as current systems are often trained and evaluated in highly controlled environments. In our contribution, the system's capabilities are analyzed within a controlled environment -- where external tracking is available for ground-truth comparison -- but also demonstrated in a challenging, uninstrumented environment -- where ground-truth measurements were never available. We show that our approach can match the performance of professional human pilots in both scenarios. We also publicly release the data from the flights carried out by our approach and a world-class human pilot.

# Efficient Force and Stiffness Prediction in Robotic Produce Handling with a Piezoresistive Pressure Sensor 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于压阻式压力传感器的机器人农产品处理中高效力和刚度预测 

**Authors**: Preston Fairchild, Claudia Chen, Xiaobo Tan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13616)  

**Abstract**: Properly handling delicate produce with robotic manipulators is a major part of the future role of automation in agricultural harvesting and processing. Grasping with the correct amount of force is crucial in not only ensuring proper grip on the object, but also to avoid damaging or bruising the product. In this work, a flexible pressure sensor that is both low cost and easy to fabricate is integrated with robotic grippers for working with produce of varying shapes, sizes, and stiffnesses. The sensor is successfully integrated with both a rigid robotic gripper, as well as a pneumatically actuated soft finger. Furthermore, an algorithm is proposed for accelerated estimation of the steady-state value of the sensor output based on the transient response data, to enable real-time applications. The sensor is shown to be effective in incorporating feedback to correctly grasp objects of unknown sizes and stiffnesses. At the same time, the sensor provides estimates for these values which can be utilized for identification of qualities such as ripeness levels and bruising. It is also shown to be able to provide force feedback for objects of variable stiffnesses. This enables future use not only for produce identification, but also for tasks such as quality control and selective distribution based on ripeness levels. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 适当地使用机器人操作器处理 delicate produce 是未来农业采收和加工中自动化 rôle 的一个重要部分。正确施加力的抓取对于确保正确握持物体以及避免损坏或压伤产品至关重要。在此工作中，一种低成本且易于制造的柔性压力传感器被集成到能够处理不同形状、大小和 stiffness 的 produce 的机器人 gripper 中。该传感器成功地与一种刚性机器人 gripper 以及一种气动驱动的软手指进行了集成。此外，提出了一种算法，该算法基于瞬态响应数据加速估计传感器输出的稳态值，以实现实时应用。传感器被证明能够通过反馈正确抓取未知尺寸和 stiffness 的物体，并同时提供这些值的估计，从而用于识别如成熟度和压伤等品质。此外，该传感器还能为具有不同 stiffness 的物体提供力反馈。这不仅使其能够用于 produce 的识别，还能够用于基于成熟度的品质控制和甄选分配等任务。

# Active Tactile Exploration for Rigid Body Pose and Shape Estimation 

**Title (ZH)**: 刚体姿态与形状估计的主动触觉探索 

**Authors**: Ethan K. Gordon, Bruke Baraki, Hien Bui, Michael Posa  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13595)  

**Abstract**: General robot manipulation requires the handling of previously unseen objects. Learning a physically accurate model at test time can provide significant benefits in data efficiency, predictability, and reuse between tasks. Tactile sensing can compliment vision with its robustness to occlusion, but its temporal sparsity necessitates careful online exploration to maintain data efficiency. Direct contact can also cause an unrestrained object to move, requiring both shape and location estimation. In this work, we propose a learning and exploration framework that uses only tactile data to simultaneously determine the shape and location of rigid objects with minimal robot motion. We build on recent advances in contact-rich system identification to formulate a loss function that penalizes physical constraint violation without introducing the numerical stiffness inherent in rigid-body contact. Optimizing this loss, we can learn cuboid and convex polyhedral geometries with less than 10s of randomly collected data after first contact. Our exploration scheme seeks to maximize Expected Information Gain and results in significantly faster learning in both simulated and real-robot experiments.

# Hoecken-D Hand: A Novel Robotic Hand for Linear Parallel Pinching and Self-Adaptive Grasping 

**Title (ZH)**: Hoeken-D 手：一种新型线性并行夹持和自适应抓取的机器人手 

**Authors**: Wentao Guo, Wenzeng Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13553)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents the Hoecken-D Hand, an underactuated robotic gripper that combines a modified Hoecken linkage with a differential spring mechanism to achieve both linear parallel pinching and a mid-stroke transition to adaptive envelope. The original Hoecken linkage is reconfigured by replacing one member with differential links, preserving straight-line guidance while enabling contact-triggered reconfiguration without additional actuators. A double-parallelogram arrangement maintains fingertip parallelism during conventional pinching, whereas the differential mechanism allows one finger to wrap inward upon encountering an obstacle, improving stability on irregular or thin objects. The mechanism can be driven by a single linear actuator, minimizing complexity and cost; in our prototype, each finger is driven by its own linear actuator for simplicity. We perform kinematic modeling and force analysis to characterize grasp performance, including simulated grasping forces and spring-opening behavior under varying geometric parameters. The design was prototyped using PLA-based 3D printing, achieving a linear pinching span of approximately 200 mm. Preliminary tests demonstrate reliable grasping in both modes across a wide range of object geometries, highlighting the Hoecken-D Hand as a compact, adaptable, and cost-effective solution for manipulation in unstructured environments.

# A Novel Robot Hand with Hoeckens Linkages and Soft Phalanges for Scooping and Self-Adaptive Grasping in Environmental Constraints 

**Title (ZH)**: 一种新型hoeckens连杆与软指节机器人手，在环境约束下进行挖取和自适应抓取 

**Authors**: Wentao Guo, Yizhou Wang, Wenzeng Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13535)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a novel underactuated adaptive robotic hand, Hockens-A Hand, which integrates the Hoeckens mechanism, a double-parallelogram linkage, and a specialized four-bar linkage to achieve three adaptive grasping modes: parallel pinching, asymmetric scooping, and enveloping grasping. Hockens-A Hand requires only a single linear actuator, leveraging passive mechanical intelligence to ensure adaptability and compliance in unstructured environments. Specifically, the vertical motion of the Hoeckens mechanism introduces compliance, the double-parallelogram linkage ensures line contact at the fingertip, and the four-bar amplification system enables natural transitions between different grasping modes. Additionally, the inclusion of a mesh-textured silicone phalanx further enhances the ability to envelop objects of various shapes and sizes. This study employs detailed kinematic analysis to optimize the push angle and design the linkage lengths for optimal performance. Simulations validated the design by analyzing the fingertip motion and ensuring smooth transitions between grasping modes. Furthermore, the grasping force was analyzed using power equations to enhance the understanding of the system's this http URL validation using a 3D-printed prototype demonstrates the three grasping modes of the hand in various scenarios under environmental constraints, verifying its grasping stability and broad applicability.

**Title (ZH)**: MODUR：一种模块化双重构机器人 

**Authors**: Jie Gu, Tin Lun Lam, Chunxu Tian, Zhihao Xia, Yongheng Xing, Dan Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13356)  

**Abstract**: Modular Self-Reconfigurable Robot (MSRR) systems are a class of robots capable of forming higher-level robotic systems by altering the topological relationships between modules, offering enhanced adaptability and robustness in various environments. This paper presents a novel MSRR called MODUR, featuring dual-level reconfiguration capabilities designed to integrate reconfigurable mechanisms into MSRR. Specifically, MODUR can perform high-level self-reconfiguration among modules to create different configurations, while each module is also able to change its shape to execute basic motions. The design of MODUR primarily includes a compact connector and scissor linkage groups that provide actuation, forming a parallel mechanism capable of achieving both connector motion decoupling and adjacent position migration capabilities. Furthermore, the workspace, considering the interdependent connectors, is comprehensively analyzed, laying a theoretical foundation for the design of the module's basic motion. Finally, the motion of MODUR is validated through a series of experiments. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 模块化自重构机器人（MSRR）系统是一类能够通过改变模块之间的拓扑关系来形成更高层次的机器人系统，从而在各种环境中提供增强的适应性和鲁棒性。本文提出了一种名为MODUR的新型MSRR，具有双层重构能力，旨在将重构机制集成到MSRR中。具体而言，MODUR可以在模块之间进行高层次的自重构以形成不同的配置，而每个模块也可以改变形状以执行基本运动。MODUR的设计主要包括紧凑的连接器和剪刀连杆组，提供驱动功能，形成一个并联机构，能够实现连接器运动解耦和相邻位置迁移能力。此外，考虑到互连连接器的工作空间进行了全面分析，为模块基本运动的设计奠定了理论基础。最后，通过一系列实验验证了MODUR的运动。

# Tactile-Conditioned Diffusion Policy for Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation 

**Title (ZH)**: 触觉条件下的扩散策略用于力感知机器人 manipulation 

**Authors**: Erik Helmut, Niklas Funk, Tim Schneider, Cristiana de Farias, Jan Peters  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.13324)  

**Abstract**: Contact-rich manipulation depends on applying the correct grasp forces throughout the manipulation task, especially when handling fragile or deformable objects. Most existing imitation learning approaches often treat visuotactile feedback only as an additional observation, leaving applied forces as an uncontrolled consequence of gripper commands. In this work, we present Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation (FARM), an imitation learning framework that integrates high-dimensional tactile data to infer tactile-conditioned force signals, which in turn define a matching force-based action space. We collect human demonstrations using a modified version of the handheld Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) gripper that integrates a GelSight Mini visual tactile sensor. For deploying the learned policies, we developed an actuated variant of the UMI gripper with geometry matching our handheld version. During policy rollouts, the proposed FARM diffusion policy jointly predicts robot pose, grip width, and grip force. FARM outperforms several baselines across three tasks with distinct force requirements -- high-force, low-force, and dynamic force adaptation -- demonstrating the advantages of its two key components: leveraging force-grounded, high-dimensional tactile observations and a force-based control space. The codebase and design files are open-sourced and available at this https URL . 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 接触丰富的操作依赖于在整个操作任务中施加正确的夹持力，特别是在处理脆弱或可变形对象时。现有的大多数 imitation learning 方法通常将触觉视觉反馈仅视为额外的观察信息，而未控制夹爪命令引起的施力结果。在本文中，我们提出了 Force-Aware Robotic Manipulation (FARM)，这是一种集成高维触觉数据的 imitation learning 框架，用于推断触觉条件下的力信号，进而定义一个匹配的基于力的动作空间。我们使用一种集成了 GelSight Mini 触觉视觉传感器的修改版本的手持 Universal Manipulation Interface (UMI) 夹爪收集人类演示。为部署所学策略，我们开发了一种几何匹配手持版本的带有执行器的 UMI 夹爪。在策略展开过程中，提出的 FARM 扩散策略联合预测机器人的姿态、握持宽度和握持力。FARM 在具有不同力要求的三个任务上优于多种基准方法，证明了其两个关键组件的优势：利用基于力的高维触觉观察和力基控制空间。代码库和设计文件已开源，可在以下链接访问：this https URL。

# The Omega Turn: A General Turning Template for Elongate Robots 

**Title (ZH)**: Ω型转弯：长形机器人通用转弯模板

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12970)  

**Abstract**: Elongate limbless robots have the potential to locomote through tightly packed spaces for applications such as search-and-rescue and industrial inspections. The capability to effectively and robustly maneuver elongate limbless robots is crucial to realize such potential. However, there has been limited research on turning strategies for such systems. To achieve effective and robust turning performance in cluttered spaces, we take inspiration from a microscopic nematode, C. elegans, which exhibits remarkable maneuverability in rheologically complex environments partially because of its ability to perform omega turns. Despite recent efforts to analyze omega turn kinematics, it remains unknown if there exists a wave equation sufficient to prescribe an omega turn, let alone its reconstruction on robot platforms. Here, using a comparative theory-biology approach, we prescribe the omega turn as a superposition of two traveling waves. With wave equations as a guideline, we design a controller for limbless robots enabling robust and effective turning behaviors in lab and cluttered field environments. Finally, we show that such omega turn controllers can also generalize to elongate multi-legged robots, demonstrating an alternative effective body-driven turning strategy for elongate robots, with and without limbs. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 无肢延长型机器人有潜力在紧凑空间中进行运动，适用于搜索救援和工业检测等领域。有效地和稳健地操控无肢延长型机器人的能力对于实现这种潜力至关重要。然而，对于此类系统的转向策略研究有限。为了在拥挤空间中实现有效的稳健转向性能，我们从一种显微线虫C. elegans获得灵感，这种线虫在流变学复杂环境中表现出显著的机动性部分归因于它能够进行欧米伽转弯的能力。尽管最近对欧米伽转弯的运动学进行了分析，但仍不清楚是否存在一个波动方程能够充分规定欧米伽转弯，更不用说在机器人平台上实现其重构了。通过比较理论和生物学方法，我们将欧米伽转弯定义为两个行波的叠加。在波动方程的指导下，我们设计了一个控制器，使其能够使无肢机器人在实验室和拥挤环境中实现稳健且有效的转向行为。最后，我们展示了这样的欧米伽转弯控制器也可泛化到多腿延长型机器人，证明了延长型机器人（有腿或无腿）的有效体驱动转向策略。

# Enhancing Sampling-based Planning with a Library of Paths 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于路径库增强采样基于Planning方法 

**Authors**: Michal Minařík, Vojtěch Vonásek, Robert Pěnička  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12962)  

**Abstract**: Path planning for 3D solid objects is a challenging problem, requiring a search in a six-dimensional configuration space, which is, nevertheless, essential in many robotic applications such as bin-picking and assembly. The commonly used sampling-based planners, such as Rapidly-exploring Random Trees, struggle with narrow passages where the sampling probability is low, increasing the time needed to find a solution. In scenarios like robotic bin-picking, various objects must be transported through the same environment. However, traditional planners start from scratch each time, losing valuable information gained during the planning process. We address this by using a library of past solutions, allowing the reuse of previous experiences even when planning for a new, previously unseen object. Paths for a set of objects are stored, and when planning for a new object, we find the most similar one in the library and use its paths as approximate solutions, adjusting for possible mutual transformations. The configuration space is then sampled along the approximate paths. Our method is tested in various narrow passage scenarios and compared with state-of-the-art methods from the OMPL library. Results show significant speed improvements (up to 85% decrease in the required time) of our method, often finding a solution in cases where the other planners fail. Our implementation of the proposed method is released as an open-source package. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 3D实体对象的路径规划是一个具有挑战性的问题，需要在六维配置空间中进行搜索，尽管如此，在诸如料箱拣选和装配等许多机器人应用中仍然至关重要。常用的基于采样的规划器，如快速扩展随机树，难以处理采样概率低的狭窄通道，从而增加了找到解决方案所需的时间。在如机器人类料箱拣选场景中，各种对象必须通过相同的环境进行运输。然而，传统规划器每次从头开始，会丢失在规划过程中获得的重要信息。我们通过使用过去的解决方案库解决了这一问题，即使在为新且未见过的对象进行规划时，也能重用之前的经历。对于一组对象的路径进行存储，在为新对象规划路径时，我们找到库中最相似的路径并使用其路径作为近似解决方案，调整可能的相关变换。然后沿近似路径对配置空间进行采样。我们的方法在各种狭窄通道场景下进行了测试，并与OMPL库中的先进方法进行了比较。结果显示，我们的方法在所需时间上取得了显著的加速（最多可减少85%），通常能够在其他规划器失败的情况下找到解决方案。我们提出的该方法的实现已作为开源包发布。

# Geometric Model Predictive Path Integral for Agile UAV Control with Online Collision Avoidance 

**Title (ZH)**: 几何模型预测路径积分在带在线碰撞 avoidance 的敏捷无人机控制中应用 

**Authors**: Pavel Pochobradský, Ondřej Procházka, Robert Pěnička, Vojtěch Vonásek, Martin Saska  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12924)  

**Abstract**: In this letter, we introduce Geometric Model Predictive Path Integral (GMPPI), a sampling-based controller capable of tracking agile trajectories while avoiding obstacles. In each iteration, GMPPI generates a large number of candidate rollout trajectories and then averages them to create a nominal control to be followed by the Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). We propose using geometric SE(3) control to generate part of the rollout trajectories, significantly increasing precision in agile flight. Furthermore, we introduce varying rollout simulation time step length and dynamic cost and noise parameters, vastly improving tracking performance of smooth and low-speed trajectories over an existing Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) implementation. Finally, we propose an integration of GMPPI with a stereo depth camera, enabling online obstacle avoidance at high speeds, a crucial step towards autonomous UAV flights in complex environments. The proposed controller can track simulated agile reference trajectories with position error similar to the geometric SE(3) controller. However, the same configuration of the proposed controller can avoid obstacles in a simulated forest environment at speeds of up to 13m/s, surpassing the performance of a state-of-the-art obstacle-aware planner. In real-world experiments, GMPPI retains the capability to track agile trajectories and avoids obstacles at speeds of up to 10m/s.

# Learning to Grasp Anything by Playing with Random Toys 

**Title (ZH)**: 通过玩随机玩具学习抓取一切 

**Authors**: Dantong Niu, Yuvan Sharma, Baifeng Shi, Rachel Ding, Matteo Gioia, Haoru Xue, Henry Tsai, Konstantinos Kallidromitis, Anirudh Pai, Shankar Shastry, Trevor Darrell, Jitendra Malik, Roei Herzig  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.12866)  

**Abstract**: Robotic manipulation policies often struggle to generalize to novel objects, limiting their real-world utility. In contrast, cognitive science suggests that children develop generalizable dexterous manipulation skills by mastering a small set of simple toys and then applying that knowledge to more complex items. Inspired by this, we study if similar generalization capabilities can also be achieved by robots. Our results indicate robots can learn generalizable grasping using randomly assembled objects that are composed from just four shape primitives: spheres, cuboids, cylinders, and rings. We show that training on these "toys" enables robust generalization to real-world objects, yielding strong zero-shot performance. Crucially, we find the key to this generalization is an object-centric visual representation induced by our proposed detection pooling mechanism. Evaluated in both simulation and on physical robots, our model achieves a 67% real-world grasping success rate on the YCB dataset, outperforming state-of-the-art approaches that rely on substantially more in-domain data. We further study how zero-shot generalization performance scales by varying the number and diversity of training toys and the demonstrations per toy. We believe this work offers a promising path to scalable and generalizable learning in robotic manipulation. Demonstration videos, code, checkpoints and our dataset are available on our project page: this https URL . 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 机器人抓取策略往往难以应用于新型物体，限制了其在实际环境中的应用价值。相比之下，认知科学表明，儿童通过掌握少量简单的玩具并将其知识应用于更复杂的物品来发展出可泛化的灵巧操作技能。受此启发，我们研究是否可以通过类似的方式令机器人也具备类似的泛化能力。结果表明，机器人可以使用仅由四种形状基元（球体、立方体、圆柱体和环体）组合而成的随机组装物体来学习可泛化的抓取策略。我们展示，通过训练来熟悉这些“玩具”，机器人可以实现对真实世界物体的稳健泛化，展现出强大的零样本性能。关键在于我们提出的检测聚池机制诱导的对象为中心的视觉表示。在模拟和物理机器人上进行评估，我们的模型在YCB数据集上的真实世界抓取成功率达到了67%，超越了依赖大量领域数据的最新方法。我们还探讨了零样本泛化性能随训练玩具数量和多样性以及每个玩具演示数量变化的规律。我们认为这项工作为可扩展和泛化的机器人操作学习提供了一条有前景的道路。更多详情，请参阅我们的项目页面: this https URL。
