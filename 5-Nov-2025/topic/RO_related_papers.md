**Abstract**: Aerial manipulation combines the maneuverability of multirotors with the dexterity of robotic arms to perform complex tasks in cluttered spaces. Yet planning safe, dynamically feasible trajectories remains difficult due to whole-body collision avoidance and the conservativeness of common geometric abstractions such as bounding boxes or ellipsoids. We present a whole-body motion planning and safety-critical control framework for aerial manipulators built on superquadrics (SQs). Using an SQ-plus-proxy representation, we model both the vehicle and obstacles with differentiable, geometry-accurate surfaces. Leveraging this representation, we introduce a maximum-clearance planner that fuses Voronoi diagrams with an equilibrium-manifold formulation to generate smooth, collision-aware trajectories. We further design a safety-critical controller that jointly enforces thrust limits and collision avoidance via high-order control barrier functions. In simulation, our approach outperforms sampling-based planners in cluttered environments, producing faster, safer, and smoother trajectories and exceeding ellipsoid-based baselines in geometric fidelity. Actual experiments on a physical aerial-manipulation platform confirm feasibility and robustness, demonstrating consistent performance across simulation and hardware settings.

# SuckTac: Camera-based Tactile Sucker for Unstructured Surface Perception and Interaction 

**Title (ZH)**: SuckTac: 基于相机的触觉吸盘，用于无结构表面感知与交互

**Abstract**: Suckers are significant for robots in picking, transferring, manipulation and locomotion on diverse surfaces. However, most of the existing suckers lack high-fidelity perceptual and tactile sensing, which impedes them from resolving the fine-grained geometric features and interaction status of the target surface. This limits their robust performance with irregular objects and in complex, unstructured environments. Inspired by the adaptive structure and high-performance sensory capabilities of cephalopod suckers, in this paper, we propose a novel, intelligent sucker, named SuckTac, that integrates a camera-based tactile sensor directly within its optimized structure to provide high-density perception and robust suction. Specifically, through joint structure design and optimization and based on a multi-material integrated casting technique, a camera and light source are embedded into the sucker, which enables in-situ, high-density perception of fine details like surface shape, texture and roughness. To further enhance robustness and adaptability, the sucker's mechanical design is also optimized by refining its profile, adding a compliant lip, and incorporating surface microstructure. Extensive experiments, including challenging tasks such as robotic cloth manipulation and soft mobile robot inspection, demonstrate the superior performance and broad applicability of the proposed system. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 吸杯在多样化表面上抓取、转移、操作和运动中至关重要，然而现有的吸杯大多缺乏高保真感知和触觉传感能力，这限制了它们对目标表面的精细几何特征和交互状态的解析能力，影响了它们在不规则物体和复杂非结构化环境中的稳健性能。受墨鱼吸盘自适应结构和高性能感知能力的启发，本文提出了一种新型智能吸杯SuckTac，将基于摄像头的触觉传感器直接集成在其优化结构中，提供高密度感知和稳健的吸附力。具体而言，通过联合结构设计与优化以及多材料集成铸造技术，将摄像头和光源嵌入吸杯中，实现对表面形状、纹理和粗糙度等细节的原位高密度感知。为增强其稳健性和适应性，还对其机械设计进行了优化，包括改进外形、增加顺应性唇缘和表面微结构。广泛实验，包括机器人布料操作和软体移动机器人检测等挑战性任务，证明了所提系统的优越性能和广泛应用前景。

# Kinematic and Ergonomic Design of a Robotic Arm for Precision Laparoscopic Surgery

**Abstract**: Robotic assistance in minimally invasive surgery can greatly enhance surgical precision and reduce surgeon fatigue. This paper presents a focused investigation on the kinematic and ergonomic design principles for a laparoscopic surgical robotic arm aimed at high-precision tasks. We propose a 7-degree-of-freedom (7-DOF) robotic arm system that incorporates a remote center of motion (RCM) at the instrument insertion point and ergonomic considerations to improve surgeon interaction. The design is implemented on a general-purpose robotic platform, and a series of simulated surgical tasks were performed to evaluate targeting accuracy, task efficiency, and surgeon comfort compared to conventional manual laparoscopy. Experimental results demonstrate that the optimized robotic design achieves significantly improved targeting accuracy (error reduced by over 50%) and shorter task completion times, while substantially lowering operator muscle strain and discomfort. These findings validate the importance of kinematic optimization (such as added articulations and tremor filtering) and human-centered ergonomic design in enhancing the performance of robot-assisted surgery. The insights from this work can guide the development of next-generation surgical robots that improve surgical outcomes and ergonomics for the operating team. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 微创手术中机器人辅助可以大大提高手术精确度并减轻 Surgeon 的疲劳。本文针对高精度任务，对腹腔镜手术机器人臂的运动学及人机工程学设计原则进行了深入研究。我们提出了一种7自由度（7-DOF）机器人臂系统，该系统在器械插入点处设置了远端中心运动（RCM），并考虑了人机工程学，以提高外科医生的操作体验。该设计在通用机器人平台上实现，并通过一系列模拟手术任务评估了与常规手动腹腔镜手术相比的目标精度、任务效率和外科医生舒适度。实验结果表明，优化的机器人设计显著提高了目标精度（误差减少超过50%）、缩短了任务完成时间，并大幅降低了操作者的肌肉疲劳和不适。这些发现证明了运动学优化（如增加关节和震颤过滤）和以人机工程学为中心的设计对于提高手术辅助手术表现的重要性。本研究的见解可以指导下一代手术机器人的开发，从而提高手术结果和手术团队的人体工程学。

# Census-Based Population Autonomy For Distributed Robotic Teaming 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于人口普查的分布式机器人团队自主性

**Abstract**: Collaborating teams of robots show promise due in their ability to complete missions more efficiently and with improved robustness, attributes that are particularly useful for systems operating in marine environments. A key issue is how to model, analyze, and design these multi-robot systems to realize the full benefits of collaboration, a challenging task since the domain of multi-robot autonomy encompasses both collective and individual behaviors. This paper introduces a layered model of multi-robot autonomy that uses the principle of census, or a weighted count of the inputs from neighbors, for collective decision-making about teaming, coupled with multi-objective behavior optimization for individual decision-making about actions. The census component is expressed as a nonlinear opinion dynamics model and the multi-objective behavior optimization is accomplished using interval programming. This model can be reduced to recover foundational algorithms in distributed optimization and control, while the full model enables new types of collective behaviors that are useful in real-world scenarios. To illustrate these points, a new method for distributed optimization of subgroup allocation is introduced where robots use a gradient descent algorithm to minimize portions of the cost functions that are locally known, while being influenced by the opinion states from neighbors to account for the unobserved costs. With this method the group can collectively use the information contained in the Hessian matrix of the total global cost. The utility of this model is experimentally validated in three categorically different experiments with fleets of autonomous surface vehicles: an adaptive sampling scenario, a high value unit protection scenario, and a competitive game of capture the flag. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 协作机器人团队显示出潜力，因为它们能够更高效地完成任务并具有更好的鲁棒性，这些特性特别适用于海洋环境中的系统。一个关键问题是如何建模、分析和设计这些多机器人系统以实现协作的全部益处，这是一个具有挑战性的工作，因为多机器人自主性的领域涵盖了集体行为和个体行为。本文介绍了一种分层的多机器人自主性模型，该模型使用邻近输入加权计数（即普查）的原则进行集体决策，确定团队合作方式，并结合多目标行为优化进行个体行动决策。普查部分表达为非线性意见动力学模型，而多目标行为优化则通过区间规划实现。该模型可以简化以恢复分布式优化和控制的基石算法，而在完整模型中则能够实现新的集体行为，这在实际场景中很有用。为了说明这一点，提出了一种新的分布式优化子组分配方法，其中机器人使用梯度下降算法最小化局部已知的成本函数部分，同时受到邻居意见状态的影响来考虑未观察到的成本。通过这种方法，群体可以共同利用全局总成本海森矩阵中包含的信息。该模型在三种不同类别的一系列自主水面航行器舰队实验中得到了实验验证：自适应采样场景、高价值单元保护场景以及夺旗竞技游戏。

# TACO: Trajectory-Aware Controller Optimization for Quadrotors 

**Title (ZH)**: TACO: 轨迹感知旋翼无人机控制器优化 

**Authors**: Hersh Sanghvi, Spencer Folk, Vijay Kumar, Camillo Jose Taylor  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2511.02060)  

**Abstract**: Controller performance in quadrotor trajectory tracking depends heavily on parameter tuning, yet standard approaches often rely on fixed, manually tuned parameters that sacrifice task-specific performance. We present Trajectory-Aware Controller Optimization (TACO), a framework that adapts controller parameters online based on the upcoming reference trajectory and current quadrotor state. TACO employs a learned predictive model and a lightweight optimization scheme to optimize controller gains in real time with respect to a broad class of trajectories, and can also be used to adapt trajectories to improve dynamic feasibility while respecting smoothness constraints. To enable large-scale training, we also introduce a parallelized quadrotor simulator supporting fast data collection on diverse trajectories. Experiments on a variety of trajectory types show that TACO outperforms conventional, static parameter tuning while operating orders of magnitude faster than black-box optimization baselines, enabling practical real-time deployment on a physical quadrotor. Furthermore, we show that adapting trajectories using TACO significantly reduces the tracking error obtained by the quadrotor. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 四旋翼轨迹跟踪中控制器性能高度依赖于参数调整，而传统方法往往依赖于固定的手动调整参数，牺牲了任务特定的性能。我们提出了轨迹感知控制器优化（TACO）框架，该框架能够根据即将到来的参考轨迹和当前四旋翼状态在线调整控制器参数。TACO 使用了学习预测模型和轻量级优化方案，能够实时针对广泛类别的轨迹优化控制器增益，并且还可以用于适应轨迹以改进动态可行性同时遵守平滑性约束。为了实现大规模训练，我们还引入了一个并行四旋翼模拟器，支持在多样化的轨迹上快速收集数据。实验结果显示，TACO 在各种轨迹类型上表现出色，性能远超黑盒优化基线，能够在物理四旋翼上实现实用的实时部署。此外，我们展示了使用 TACO 调整轨迹可以显著减少四旋翼的跟踪误差。
