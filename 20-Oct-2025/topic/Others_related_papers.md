**Abstract**: Traditionally, prediction and planning in autonomous driving (AD) have been treated as separate, sequential modules. Recently, there has been a growing shift towards tighter integration of these components, known as Integrated Prediction and Planning (IPP), with the aim of enabling more informed and adaptive decision-making. However, it remains unclear to what extent this integration actually improves planning performance. In this work, we investigate the role of prediction in IPP approaches, drawing on the widely adopted Val14 benchmark, which encompasses more common driving scenarios with relatively low interaction complexity, and the interPlan benchmark, which includes highly interactive and out-of-distribution driving situations. Our analysis reveals that even access to perfect future predictions does not lead to better planning outcomes, indicating that current IPP methods often fail to fully exploit future behavior information. Instead, we focus on high-quality proposal generation, while using predictions primarily for collision checks. We find that many imitation learning-based planners struggle to generate realistic and plausible proposals, performing worse than PDM - a simple lane-following approach. Motivated by this observation, we build on PDM with an enhanced proposal generation method, shifting the emphasis towards producing diverse but realistic and high-quality proposals. This proposal-centric approach significantly outperforms existing methods, especially in out-of-distribution and highly interactive settings, where it sets new state-of-the-art results. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 传统上，自主驾驶中的预测和规划被视为分离的、顺序的模块。近年来，人们越来越倾向于将这些组件通过集成预测和规划（IPP）进行更紧密的集成，目的是实现更具信息量和适应性的决策。然而，目前仍不清楚这种集成在多大程度上改善了规划性能。在本文中，我们研究了IPP方法中预测的作用，采用了广泛采用的Val14基准测试，该基准涵盖了具有相对较低交互复杂性的常见驾驶场景，以及包括高度交互和分布外驾驶情况的interPlan基准测试。我们的分析表明，即使拥有完美的未来预测信息也不一定能得到更好的规划结果，表明当前的IPP方法往往未能充分利用未来行为信息。相反，我们侧重于高质量提案的生成，主要利用预测进行碰撞检查。我们发现，许多基于模仿学习的规划器难以生成逼真且合理的提案，其表现甚至不如简单的车道跟随方法PDM。受此观察的启发，我们基于PDM构建了一个改进的提案生成方法，着重于生成多样化但逼真且高质量的提案。这种以提案为中心的方法在分布外和高度交互的设置中显著优于现有方法，特别是在这些设置中，它设定了新的最佳成果。

**Abstract**: Natural and human-made disasters can cause severe devastation and claim thousands of lives worldwide. Therefore, developing efficient methods for disaster response and management is a critical task for relief teams. One of the most essential components of effective response is the rapid collection of information about affected areas, damages, and victims. More data translates into better coordination, faster rescue operations, and ultimately, more lives saved. However, in some disasters, such as earthquakes, the communication infrastructure is often partially or completely destroyed, making it extremely difficult for victims to send distress signals and for rescue teams to locate and assist them in time. Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as valuable tools in such scenarios. In particular, a fleet of UAVs can be dispatched from a mobile station to the affected area to facilitate data collection and establish temporary communication networks. Nevertheless, real-world deployment of UAVs faces several challenges, with adverse weather conditions--especially wind--being among the most significant. To address this, we develop a novel mathematical framework to determine the optimal location of a mobile UAV station while explicitly accounting for the heterogeneity of the UAVs and the effect of wind. In particular, we generalize the Sylvester problem to introduce the Sylvester-Fermat-Torricelli (SFT) problem, which captures complex factors such as wind influence, UAV heterogeneity, and back-and-forth motion within a unified framework. The proposed framework enhances the practicality of UAV-based disaster response planning by accounting for real-world factors such as wind and UAV heterogeneity. Experimental results demonstrate that it can reduce wasted operational time by up to 84%, making post-disaster missions significantly more efficient and effective. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 自然和人为灾害会导致严重的破坏并夺走数千条生命。因此，对于救援团队而言，开发高效的灾害响应和管理方法是一项关键任务。有效响应的核心之一是快速收集受灾区域、损失和受害者的信息。更多信息意味着更好的协调、更快的救援行动，最终拯救更多生命。然而，在地震等灾害中，通信基础设施经常部分或完全被破坏，使得受害者发送求救信号和救援队伍及时定位并提供援助变得极其困难。无人驾驶航空器（UAV）在这种情况下成为了有价值的工具。特别是在这种场景中，可以派遣一系列UAV从移动站出发到达受灾区域以促进数据收集并建立临时通信网络。然而，实际部署UAV面临着一系列挑战，其中最严峻的是恶劣天气条件，特别是风力。为此，我们开发了一个新颖的数学框架，以确定移动UAV站的最佳位置，同时明确考虑了UAV的异质性和风的影响。具体来说，我们将塞瓦尔德问题推广为引入塞瓦尔德-费马-托里埃利（SFT）问题，该问题在一个统一的框架中捕捉了风的影响、UAV的异质性和往返运动等复杂因素。所提出框架通过考虑实际因素，如风和UAV异质性，提高了基于UAV的灾害响应规划的实用性。实验结果表明，它可以将无效操作时间减少多达84%，使灾害后的任务显著更高效和更有成效。
