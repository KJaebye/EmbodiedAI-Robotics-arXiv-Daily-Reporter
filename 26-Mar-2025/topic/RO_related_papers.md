**Abstract**: Applying reinforcement learning to autonomous driving has garnered widespread attention. However, classical reinforcement learning methods optimize policies by maximizing expected rewards but lack sufficient safety considerations, often putting agents in hazardous situations. This paper proposes a risk-aware reinforcement learning approach for autonomous driving to improve the safety performance when crossing the intersection. Safe critics are constructed to evaluate driving risk and work in conjunction with the reward critic to update the actor. Based on this, a Lagrangian relaxation method and cyclic gradient iteration are combined to project actions into a feasible safe region. Furthermore, a Multi-hop and Multi-layer perception (MLP) mixed Attention Mechanism (MMAM) is incorporated into the actor-critic network, enabling the policy to adapt to dynamic traffic and overcome permutation sensitivity challenges. This allows the policy to focus more effectively on surrounding potential risks while enhancing the identification of passing opportunities. Simulation tests are conducted on different tasks at unsignalized intersections. The results show that the proposed approach effectively reduces collision rates and improves crossing efficiency in comparison to baseline algorithms. Additionally, our ablation experiments demonstrate the benefits of incorporating risk-awareness and MMAM into RL. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 将经典强化学习方法应用于自动驾驶引发了广泛关注。然而，传统强化学习方法通过最大化预期奖励优化策略，但在安全考虑方面存在不足，往往会将智能体置于危险境地。本文提出了一种风险感知强化学习方法，以提高自动驾驶在交叉路口穿越时的安全性能。构造了安全评论家来评估驾驶风险，并与奖励评论家协同工作以更新行为者。在此基础上，结合了拉格朗日松弛方法和循环梯度迭代，将动作投影到可行的安全区域内。此外，将多跳和多层感知机混合注意力机制（MMAM）整合到行为者-评论家网络中，使策略能够适应动态交通并克服排列敏感性挑战。这使得策略能够更有效地关注周围潜在风险，同时增强对通行机会的识别。在无信号交叉路口的不同任务中进行了仿真测试。结果表明，所提出的方法在与基线算法相比时，有效降低了碰撞率并提高了穿越效率。另外，我们的消融实验展示了将风险感知和MMAM整合到RL中的益处。

**Abstract**: The inherent challenges of robotic underwater exploration, such as hydrodynamic effects, the complexity of dynamic coupling, and the necessity for sensitive interaction with marine life, call for the adoption of soft robotic approaches in marine exploration. To address this, we present a novel prototype, ZodiAq, a soft underwater drone inspired by prokaryotic bacterial flagella. ZodiAq's unique dodecahedral structure, equipped with 12 flagella-like arms, ensures design redundancy and compliance, ideal for navigating complex underwater terrains. The prototype features a central unit based on a Raspberry Pi, connected to a sensory system for inertial, depth, and vision detection, and an acoustic modem for communication. Combined with the implemented control law, it renders ZodiAq an intelligent system. This paper details the design and fabrication process of ZodiAq, highlighting design choices and prototype capabilities. Based on the strain-based modeling of Cosserat rods, we have developed a digital twin of the prototype within a simulation toolbox to ease analysis and control. To optimize its operation in dynamic aquatic conditions, a simplified model-based controller has been developed and implemented, facilitating intelligent and adaptive movement in the hydrodynamic environment. Extensive experimental demonstrations highlight the drone's potential, showcasing its design redundancy, embodied intelligence, crawling gait, and practical applications in diverse underwater settings. This research contributes significantly to the field of underwater soft robotics, offering a promising new avenue for safe, efficient, and environmentally conscious underwater exploration.

**Title (ZH)**: 一种具有可调方向推进器的新型水下车辆：设计与自适应跟踪控制

**Abstract**: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are essential for marine exploration and research. However, conventional designs often struggle with limited maneuverability in complex, dynamic underwater environments. This paper introduces an innovative orientation-adjustable thruster AUV (OATAUV), equipped with a redundant vector thruster configuration that enables full six-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) motion and composite maneuvers. To overcome challenges associated with uncertain model parameters and environmental disturbances, a novel feedforward adaptive model predictive controller (FFAMPC) is proposed to ensure robust trajectory tracking, which integrates real-time state feedback with adaptive parameter updates. Extensive experiments, including closed-loop tracking and composite motion tests in a laboratory pool, validate the enhanced performance of the OAT-AUV. The results demonstrate that the OAT-AUV's redundant vector thruster configuration enables 23.8% cost reduction relative to common vehicles, while the FF-AMPC controller achieves 68.6% trajectory tracking improvement compared to PID controllers. Uniquely, the system executes composite helical/spiral trajectories unattainable by similar vehicles.

**Abstract**: We introduce CoinFT, a capacitive 6-axis force/torque (F/T) sensor that is compact, light, low-cost, and robust with an average mean-squared error of 0.11N for force and 0.84mNm for moment when the input ranges from 0~10N and 0~4N in normal and shear directions, respectively. CoinFT is a stack of two rigid PCBs with comb-shaped electrodes connected by an array of silicone rubber pillars. The microcontroller interrogates the electrodes in different subsets in order to enhance sensitivity for measuring 6-axis F/T. The combination of desirable features of CoinFT enables various contact-rich robot interactions at a scale, across different embodiment domains including drones, robot end-effectors, and wearable haptic devices. We demonstrate the utility of CoinFT on drones by performing an attitude-based force control to perform tasks that require careful contact force modulation. The design, fabrication, and firmware of CoinFT are open-sourced at this https URL.

**Authors**: Robinson Umeike  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19171)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents an implementation and analysis of a five-fingered robotic grasping system that combines contact-based control with inverse kinematics solutions. Using the PyBullet simulation environment and the DexHand v2 model, we demonstrate a comprehensive approach to achieving stable grasps through contact point optimization with force closure validation. Our method achieves movement efficiency ratings between 0.966-0.996 for non-thumb fingers and 0.879 for the thumb, while maintaining positional accuracy within 0.0267-0.0283m for non-thumb digits and 0.0519m for the thumb. The system demonstrates rapid position stabilization at 240Hz simulation frequency and maintains stable contact configurations throughout the grasp execution. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of our approach, while also identifying areas for future enhancement in thumb opposition movements and horizontal plane control.

# Dom, cars don't fly! -- Or do they? In-Air Vehicle Maneuver for High-Speed Off-Road Navigation 

**Title (ZH)**: _dom, 车辆不会飞！_ 或者它们会？空中车辆机动在高速离线导航中的应用_ 

**Authors**: Anuj Pokhrel, Aniket Datar, Xuesu Xiao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19140)  

**Abstract**: When pushing the speed limit for aggressive off-road navigation on uneven terrain, it is inevitable that vehicles may become airborne from time to time. During time-sensitive tasks, being able to fly over challenging terrain can also save time, instead of cautiously circumventing or slowly negotiating through. However, most off-road autonomy systems operate under the assumption that the vehicles are always on the ground and therefore limit operational speed. In this paper, we present a novel approach for in-air vehicle maneuver during high-speed off-road navigation. Based on a hybrid forward kinodynamic model using both physics principles and machine learning, our fixed-horizon, sampling-based motion planner ensures accurate vehicle landing poses and their derivatives within a short airborne time window using vehicle throttle and steering commands. We test our approach in extensive in-air experiments both indoors and outdoors, compare it against an error-driven control method, and demonstrate that precise and timely in-air vehicle maneuver is possible through existing ground vehicle controls.

# Cooperative Control of Multi-Quadrotors for Transporting Cable-Suspended Payloads: Obstacle-Aware Planning and Event-Based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control 

**Title (ZH)**: 多旋翼协同控制运输电缆悬吊载荷：基于障碍物感知的事件触发非线性模型预测控制 

**Authors**: Tohid Kargar Tasooji, Sakineh Khodadadi, Guangjun Liu, Richard Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19135)  

**Abstract**: This paper introduces a novel methodology for the cooperative control of multiple quadrotors transporting cablesuspended payloads, emphasizing obstacle-aware planning and event-based Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC). Our approach integrates trajectory planning with real-time control through a combination of the A* algorithm for global path planning and NMPC for local control, enhancing trajectory adaptability and obstacle avoidance. We propose an advanced event-triggered control system that updates based on events identified through dynamically generated environmental maps. These maps are constructed using a dual-camera setup, which includes multi-camera systems for static obstacle detection and event cameras for high-resolution, low-latency detection of dynamic obstacles. This design is crucial for addressing fast-moving and transient obstacles that conventional cameras may overlook, particularly in environments with rapid motion and variable lighting conditions. When new obstacles are detected, the A* algorithm recalculates waypoints based on the updated map, ensuring safe and efficient navigation. This real-time obstacle detection and map updating integration allows the system to adaptively respond to environmental changes, markedly improving safety and navigation efficiency. The system employs SLAM and object detection techniques utilizing data from multi-cameras, event cameras, and IMUs for accurate localization and comprehensive environmental mapping. The NMPC framework adeptly manages the complex dynamics of multiple quadrotors and suspended payloads, incorporating safety constraints to maintain dynamic feasibility and stability. Extensive simulations validate the proposed approach, demonstrating significant enhancements in energy efficiency, computational resource management, and responsiveness.

**Authors**: Muhammad Al-Zafar Khan, Jamal Al-Karaki  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.19699)  

**Abstract**: In this study, we formulate the drone delivery problem as a control problem and solve it using Model Predictive Control. Two experiments are performed: The first is on a less challenging grid world environment with lower dimensionality, and the second is with a higher dimensionality and added complexity. The MPC method was benchmarked against three popular Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL): Independent $Q$-Learning (IQL), Joint Action Learners (JAL), and Value-Decomposition Networks (VDN). It was shown that the MPC method solved the problem quicker and required fewer optimal numbers of drones to achieve a minimized cost and navigate the optimal path.
