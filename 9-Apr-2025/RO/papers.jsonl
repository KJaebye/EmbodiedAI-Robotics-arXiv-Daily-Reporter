But -- because people are inherently unpredictable -- it is often difficult for robots to plan safe behaviors. Instead of relying on our ability to anticipate humans, here we identify robot policies that are robust to unexpected human decisions. We achieve this by formulating human-robot interaction as a zero-sum game, where (in the worst case) the human's actions directly conflict with the robot's objective. Solving for the Nash Equilibrium of this game provides robot policies that maximize safety and performance across a wide range of human actions. Existing approaches attempt to find these optimal policies by leveraging Hamilton-Jacobi analysis (which is intractable) or linear-quadratic approximations (which are inexact). By contrast, in this work we propose a computationally efficient and theoretically justified method that converges towards the Nash Equilibrium policy. Our approach (which we call MCLQ) leverages linear-quadratic games to obtain an initial guess at safe robot behavior, and then iteratively refines that guess with a Monte Carlo search. Not only does MCLQ provide real-time safety adjustments, but it also enables the designer to tune how conservative the robot is -- preventing the system from focusing on unrealistic human behaviors.

However a major issue of EIT-based tactile sensors when applied in highly deformable objects is their performance degradation due to surface deformations. This limitation stems from their inherent sensitivity to strain, which is particularly exacerbated in soft bodies, thus requiring dedicated data interpretation to disentangle the parameter being measured and the signal deriving from shape changes. This has largely limited their practical implementations. This paper presents a machine learning-assisted tactile sensing approach to address this challenge by tracking surface deformations and segregating this contribution in the signal readout during tactile sensing. We first capture the deformations of the target object, followed by tactile reconstruction using a deep learning model specifically designed to process and fuse EIT data and deformation information.

Nevertheless, the operation of a dual-arm manipulator poses a dynamic challenge, as the CoM (center of mass) of the system changes with manipulator movement, potentially impacting the multirotor UAV. Additionally, unmodeled effects, parameter uncertainties, and external disturbances can significantly degrade control performance, leading to unforeseen dangers. To tackle these issues, this paper proposes a nonlinear adaptive RISE (robust integral of the sign of the error) controller based on DNN (deep neural network). The first step involves establishing the kinematic and dynamic model of the dual-arm aerial manipulator. Subsequently, the adaptive RISE controller is proposed with a DNN feedforward term to effectively address both internal and external challenges. By employing Lyapunov techniques, the asymptotic convergence of the tracking error signals are guaranteed rigorously. Notably, this paper marks a pioneering effort by presenting the first DNN-based adaptive RISE controller design accompanied by a comprehensive stability analysis.

Among various guidance strategies presented in literature, look-ahead distance ($L_1$)-based guidance method has received significant attention due to its ease in implementation and ability to maintain a low cross-track error while following simpler reference paths and generate bounded lateral acceleration commands. However, the constant value of $L_1$ becomes problematic when the UxV is far away from the reference path and also produce higher cross-track error while following complex reference paths having high variation in radius of curvature. To address these challenges, the notion of look-ahead distance is leveraged in a novel way to develop a two-phase guidance strategy. Initially, when the UxV is far from the reference path, an optimized $L_1$ selection strategy is developed to guide the UxV toward the reference path in order to maintain minimal lateral acceleration command. Once the vehicle reaches a close vicinity of the reference path, a novel notion of corrector point is incorporated in the constant $L_1$-based guidance scheme to generate the lateral acceleration command that effectively reduces the root mean square of the cross-track error thereafter. Simulation results demonstrate that this proposed corrector point and look-ahead point pair-based guidance strategy along with the developed midcourse guidance scheme outperforms the conventional constant $L_1$ guidance scheme both in terms of feasibility and measures of effectiveness like cross-track error and lateral acceleration requirements.', 'abstract_zh': '基于前瞻距离的两阶段导航策略在自主车辆中的高效路径跟踪', 'title_zh': '基于校正辅助前瞻距离导向的参考路径跟随及高效中程导向策略'}

To address these problems, this paper proposes a novel framework called Prior Transfer Reinforcement Learning (PTRL), which improves both training efficiency and model transferability across different robots. Drawing inspiration from model transfer techniques in deep learning, PTRL introduces a fine-tuning mechanism that selectively freezes layers of the policy network during transfer, making it the first to apply such a method in RL. The framework consists of three stages: pre-training on a source robot using the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm, transferring the learned policy to a target robot, and fine-tuning with partial network freezing. Extensive experiments on various robot platforms confirm that this approach significantly reduces training time while maintaining or even improving performance. Moreover, the study quantitatively analyzes how the ratio of frozen layers affects transfer results, providing valuable insights into optimizing the process.

In this work, we investigate the problem of jamming attack detection in static and dynamic vehicular networks. We utilize ESP32-S3 modules to set up a communication network between an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) and a Ground Control Station (GCS), to experimentally test the combined effects of a constant jammer on recorded CSI parameters, and the feasibility of jamming detection through CSI analysis in static and dynamic communication scenarios.', 'abstract_zh': '基于IEEE 802.11标准的网络在过去十年中经历了快速增长，其应用领域广泛，包括智能家居应用、物联网（IoT）以及短距离高吞吐量的静态和动态车载通信网络。在这些网络中，信道状态信息（CSI）提供了一个详细的通信信道状态视图，并代表了多径传播、散射、相位变化、衰落和功率衰减的综合影响。本文研究了在静态和动态车载网络中检测干扰攻击的问题。我们利用ESP32-S3模块设置了一个无人飞行器（UAV）与地面控制站（GCS）之间的通信网络，通过实验测试恒定干扰对记录的CSI参数的影响，并探讨通过CSI分析在静态和动态通信场景中检测干扰的可能性。', 'title_zh': '静态和动态无人机网络中Jamming攻击检测的信道状态信息分析——一项实验研究'}

For this problem class, conventional optimizers suffer from small step sizes and slow convergence. We propose BC-ADMM, a variant of Alternating Direction Method of Multiplier (ADMM), that can solve a class of non-convex constrained optimizations with biconvex constraint relaxation. Our algorithm allows larger step sizes by breaking the problem into small-scale sub-problems that can be easily solved in parallel. We show that our method has both theoretical convergence speed guarantees and practical convergence guarantees in the asymptotic sense. Through numerical experiments in a row of four robotic applications, we show that BC-ADMM has faster convergence than conventional gradient descent and Newton's method in terms of wall clock time.", 'abstract_zh': '非凸约束优化在机器人应用中普遍存在，如多agent导航、UAV轨迹优化和软机器人仿真。针对这一问题类别，传统的优化器存在步长小和收敛慢的问题。我们提出了一种交替方向乘子法（ADMM）的变体BC-ADMM，它可以解决一类通过双凸约束松弛处理的非凸约束优化问题。该算法通过将问题分解为可并行解决的小规模子问题，允许使用更大的步长。我们证明了该方法在理论和实际意义上都具有收敛速度保证。通过在四类机器人应用中的数值实验，我们展示了BC-ADMM在墙钟时间上比常规梯度下降法和牛顿法具有更快的收敛速度。', 'title_zh': 'BC-ADMM: 一种高效非凸约束优化器及其在机器人领域的应用'}

Most state-of-the-art (SotA) prediction models primarily focus on forecasting the most likely future. However, for the safe operation of autonomous vehicles, it is equally important to cover the distribution for plausible motion alternatives. To address this, we introduce EP-Diffuser, a novel parameter-efficient diffusion-based generative model designed to capture the distribution of possible traffic scene evolutions. Conditioned on road layout and agent history, our model acts as a predictor and generates diverse, plausible scene continuations. We benchmark EP-Diffuser against two SotA models in terms of accuracy and plausibility of predictions on the Argoverse 2 dataset. Despite its significantly smaller model size, our approach achieves both highly accurate and plausible traffic scene predictions. We further evaluate model generalization ability in an out-of-distribution (OoD) test setting using Waymo Open dataset and show superior robustness of our approach.
