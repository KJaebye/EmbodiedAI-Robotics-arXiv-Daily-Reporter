**Abstract**: Robotic surgery is a rapidly developing field that can greatly benefit from the automation of surgical tasks. However, training techniques such as Reinforcement Learning (RL) require a high number of task repetitions, which are generally unsafe and impractical to perform on real surgical systems. This stresses the need for simulated surgical environments, which are not only realistic, but also computationally efficient and scalable. We introduce FF-SRL (Fast and Flexible Surgical Reinforcement Learning), a high-performance learning environment for robotic surgery. In FF-SRL both physics simulation and RL policy training reside entirely on a single GPU. This avoids typical bottlenecks associated with data transfer between the CPU and GPU, leading to accelerated learning rates. Our results show that FF-SRL reduces the training time of a complex tissue manipulation task by an order of magnitude, down to a couple of minutes, compared to a common CPU/GPU simulator. Such speed-up may facilitate the experimentation with RL techniques and contribute to the development of new generation of surgical systems. To this end, we make our code publicly available to the community.

**Authors**: Yaroslav Marchukov, Luis Montano  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18545)  

**Abstract**: In the present work we address the problem of deploying a team of robots in a scenario where some locations of interest must be reached. Thus, a planning for a deployment is required, before sending the robots. The obstacles, the limited communication range, and the need of communicating to a base station, constrain the connectivity of the team and the deployment planning. We propose a method consisting of three algorithms: a distributed path planner to obtain communication-aware trajectories; a deployment planner providing dual-use of the robots, visiting primary goals and performing connectivity tasks; and a clustering algorithm to allocate the tasks to robots, and obtain the best goal visit order for the mission.

# Analysis of Forces Exerted by Shoulder and Elbow Fabric-based Pneumatic Actuators for Pediatric Exosuits 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于肩部和肘部织物气动执行器的作用力分析：针对儿童外骨骼Modification of Title to Match Academic Norms: 儿童外骨骼中肩部和肘部织物气动执行器作用力分析 

**Authors**: Mehrnoosh Ayazi, Ipsita Sahin, Caio Mucchiani, Elena Kokkoni, Konstantinos Karydis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18376)  

**Abstract**: To enhance pediatric exosuit design, it is crucial to assess the actuator-generated forces. This work evaluates the contact forces exerted by soft fabric-based pneumatic actuators in an upper extremity pediatric exosuit. Two actuators were examined: a single-cell bidirectional actuator for shoulder abduction/adduction and a bellow-type actuator for elbow extension/flexion. Experiments assessed the impact of actuator anchoring points and the adjacent joint's angle on exerted forces and actuated joint range of motion (ROM). These were measured via load cells and encoders integrated into a custom infant-scale engineered apparatus with two degrees of freedom (two revolute joints). For the shoulder actuator, results show that anchoring it further from the shoulder joint center while the elbow is flexed at $90^\circ$ yields the highest ROM while minimizing the peak force exerted on the body. For the elbow actuator, anchoring it symmetrically while the shoulder joint is at $0^\circ$ optimizes actuator performance. These findings contribute a key step toward co-optimizing the considered exosuit design for functionality and wearability. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 为了增强儿科外骨骼设计，评估执行器产生的力至关重要。本研究评估了基于柔软织物的气动执行器在上肢儿科外骨骼中的接触力。本研究考查了两种执行器：一个多腔双向执行器用于肩外展/内收，一种气囊式执行器用于肘伸展/屈曲。实验评估了执行器固定点和相邻关节角度对施加力和驱动关节活动范围（ROM）的影响。这些数据通过集成在具有两个自由度（两个回转关节）的定制婴儿尺度工程装置中的载荷传感器和编码器进行测量。对于肩部执行器，结果表明，在肘关节屈曲90°时，将执行器固定点远离肩关节中心，可实现最高的ROM并最小化对身体的峰值力。对于肘部执行器，当肩关节位于0°时，对称固定执行器能优化执行器性能。这些发现为优化考虑中的外骨骼设计以实现功能性和舒适性奠定了关键步骤。

**Abstract**: Multi-rotors face significant risks, as actuator failures at high altitudes can easily result in a crash and the robot's destruction. Therefore, rapid fault recovery in the event of an actuator failure is necessary for the fault-tolerant and safe operation of unmanned aerial robots. In this work, we present a fault recovery approach based on the unification of posture manipulation and thrust vectoring. The key contributions of this work are: 1) Derivation of two flight dynamics models (high-fidelity and reduced-order) that capture posture control and thrust vectoring. 2) Design of a controller based on Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) and demonstration of fault recovery in simulation using a high-fidelity model of the Multi-Modal Mobility Morphobot (M4) in Simscape.

# Assist-as-needed Hip Exoskeleton Control for Gait Asymmetry Correction via Human-in-the-loop Optimization 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于人为环优化的按需髋外骨骼控制以纠正步态不对称 

**Authors**: Yuepeng Qian, Jingfeng Xiong, Haoyong Yu, Chenglong Fu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18051)  

**Abstract**: Gait asymmetry is a significant clinical characteristic of hemiplegic gait that most stroke survivors suffer, leading to limited mobility and long-term negative impacts on their quality of life. Although a variety of exoskeleton controls have been developed for robot-assisted gait rehabilitation, little attention has been paid to correcting the gait asymmetry of stroke patients following the assist-as-need (AAN) principle, and it is still challenging to properly share control between the exoskeleton and stroke patients with partial motor control. In view of this, this article proposes an AAN hip exoskeleton control with human-in-the-loop optimization to correct gait asymmetry in stroke patients. To realize the AAN concept, an objective function was designed for real-time evaluation of the subject's gait performance and active participation, which considers the variability of natural human movement and guides the online tuning of control parameters on a subject-specific basis. In this way, patients were stimulated to contribute as much as possible to movement, thus maximizing the efficiency and outcomes of post-stroke gait rehabilitation. Finally, an experimental study was conducted to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed AAN control on healthy subjects with artificial gait impairment. For the first time, the common hypothesis that AAN controls can improve human active participation was validated from the biomechanics viewpoint. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 步态不对称是半瘫步态的重要临床特征，大多数中风幸存者都会遭受这一问题，导致活动受限并对生活质量产生长期负面影响。尽管已开发出多种外骨骼控制方法用于机器人辅助步态康复，但在遵循按需辅助（AAN）原则的基础上纠正中风患者的步态不对称问题却未受到足够关注，同时，合理地在外骨骼与具有部分运动控制能力的中风患者之间共享控制仍然是一个挑战。鉴于此，本文提出了一种包含人为在环优化的AAN髋部外骨骼控制方法，以纠正中风患者的步态不对称。为了实现AAN概念，设计了一个目标函数，用于实时评估受试者的步态表现和主动参与度，该函数考虑了自然人类运动的变异性，并根据个体情况在线调整控制参数。通过这种方式，激励患者尽其所能地参与运动，从而最大化中风后步态康复的效果。最后，通过实验证明了所提出的AAN控制方法在健康受试者中的人工步态障碍下的可行性和有效性，并从生物力学角度首次验证了AAN控制可以提高人类主动参与的普遍假设。

# Smart Ankleband for Plug-and-Play Hand-Prosthetic Control 

**Title (ZH)**: 可即插即用控制的手部假肢智能脚环 

**Authors**: Dean Zadok, Oren Salzman, Alon Wolf, Alex M. Bronstein  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17846)  

**Abstract**: Building robotic prostheses requires the creation of a sensor-based interface designed to provide the robotic hand with the control required to perform hand gestures. Traditional Electromyography (EMG) based prosthetics and emerging alternatives often face limitations such as muscle-activation limitations, high cost, and complex-calibration procedures. In this paper, we present a low-cost robotic system composed of a smart ankleband for intuitive, calibration-free control of a robotic hand, and a robotic prosthetic hand that executes actions corresponding to leg gestures. The ankleband integrates an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) sensor with a lightweight temporal neural network to infer user-intended leg gestures from motion data. Our system represents a significant step towards higher adoption rates of robotic prostheses among arm amputees, as it enables one to operate a prosthetic hand using a low-cost, low-power, and calibration-free solution. To evaluate our work, we collected data from 10 subjects and tested our prototype ankleband with a robotic hand on an individual with upper-limb amputations. Our results demonstrate that this system empowers users to perform daily tasks more efficiently, requiring few compensatory movements. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 基于传感器的接口构建机器人仿生肢需要为机器人手设计控制接口，以完成手部动作。传统基于肌电图（EMG）的假肢和新兴替代方案往往面临肌电信号限制、高成本和复杂的校准程序等局限性。本文介绍了一种低成本机器人系统，该系统包括一个智能脚踝环，实现了无需校准的机器人手的直观控制，以及一个执行与腿部动作对应的机器人仿生手。脚踝环结合了惯性测量单元（IMU）传感器和轻量级的时序神经网络，通过运动数据推断用户意图的腿部动作。我们的系统代表了朝着更高采用率的机器人假肢方向迈出的重要一步，因为它允许使用者使用低成本、低功耗且无需校准的解决方案操作仿生手。为了评估我们的工作，我们从10名受试者那里收集了数据，并在一名上肢截肢患者身上测试了我们的原型脚踝环与机器人手的结合。我们的结果表明，该系统使用户能够更高效地完成日常任务，所需的补偿动作较少。

# Adaptive Perching and Grasping by Aerial Robot with Light-weight and High Grip-force Tendon-driven Three-fingered Hand using Single Actuator 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于轻量高效绳驱动三指手单驱动器实现的 aerial 机器人自适应定点降落与抓取技术 

**Authors**: Hisaaki Iida, Junichiro Sugihara, Kazuki Sugihara, Haruki Kozuka, Jinjie Li, Keisuke Nagato, Moju Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17711)  

**Abstract**: In previous research, various types of aerial robots equipped with perching mechanisms have been developed to extend operational time. However, most existing perching methods adopt either an upward or downward approach, making it difficult to perch near walls with surrounding obstacles. Additionally, perching hands are typically designed solely for attachment to objects and lack additional functionality, imposing a payload burden during flight. To address these issues, this paper proposes a lightweight robotic hand, the "Tri-force hand", capable of both perching and object grasping, as well as a new perching method called "Pendulum-perching". The Tri-force hand is a tendon-driven, three-fingered hand utilizing a spherical joint and a two-dimensional differential plate, enabling passive actuation with a single actuator. Each finger module, designed with controllable semi-tendon drive, can conform to arbitrary shapes within its operating range, allowing both perching and adaptive object grasping. By integrating this hand into a fully actuated aerial robot, the system can perform multi-directional approaches from the side and landing using gravity. This approach is similar to Crush-perching seen in researches with fixed-wing aerial robots, but it differs in its superior control over approach speed and direction, as well as its ability to achieve stable detachment and re-launch. In experiments, the fabricated Tri-force hand demonstrated the ability to withstand a total weight of up to 27.5 kg, grasp various objects ranging from simple to complex-shaped tools, and achieve a high success rate in both perching and takeoff.

**Title (ZH)**: 基于强化学习和风险状态分类的磁吸附壁爬行机器人特征选择 

**Authors**: Zhen Ma, He Xu, Jielong Dou, Yi Qin, Xueyu Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17615)  

**Abstract**: Magnetic adhesion tracked wall-climbing robots face potential risks of overturning during high-altitude operations, making their stability crucial for ensuring safety. This study presents a dynamic feature selection method based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) reinforcement learning, combined with typical machine learning models, aimed at improving the classification accuracy of hazardous states under complex operating conditions. Firstly, this work innovatively employs a fiber rod-based MEMS attitude sensor to collect vibration data from the robot and extract high-dimensional feature vectors in both time and frequency domains. Then, a reinforcement learning model is used to dynamically select the optimal feature subset, reducing feature redundancy and enhancing classification accuracy. Finally, a CNN-LSTM deep learning model is employed for classification and recognition. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves the robot's ability to assess hazardous states across various operational scenarios, providing reliable technical support for robotic safety monitoring.

# Extending First-order Motion Planners to Second-order Dynamics 

**Title (ZH)**: 扩展基于势能的第一阶运动规划器以处理第二阶动力学 

**Authors**: Mayur Sawant, Abdelhamid Tayebi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17589)  

**Abstract**: This paper extends first-order motion planners to robots governed by second-order dynamics. Two control schemes are proposed based on the knowledge of a scalar function whose negative gradient aligns with a given first-order motion planner. When such a function is known, the first-order motion planner is combined with a damping velocity vector with a dynamic gain to extend the safety and convergence guarantees of the first-order motion planner to second-order systems. If no such function is available, we propose an alternative control scheme ensuring that the error between the robot's velocity and the first-order motion planner converges to zero. The theoretical developments are supported by simulation results demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.

# Shear-based Grasp Control for Multi-fingered Underactuated Tactile Robotic Hands 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于剪切控制的多指欠驱动触觉机器人手抓取控制 

**Authors**: Christopher J. Ford, Haoran Li, Manuel G. Catalano, Matteo Bianchi, Efi Psomopoulou, Nathan F. Lepora  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17501)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a shear-based control scheme for grasping and manipulating delicate objects with a Pisa/IIT anthropomorphic SoftHand equipped with soft biomimetic tactile sensors on all five fingertips. These `microTac' tactile sensors are miniature versions of the TacTip vision-based tactile sensor, and can extract precise contact geometry and force information at each fingertip for use as feedback into a controller to modulate the grasp while a held object is manipulated. Using a parallel processing pipeline, we asynchronously capture tactile images and predict contact pose and force from multiple tactile sensors. Consistent pose and force models across all sensors are developed using supervised deep learning with transfer learning techniques. We then develop a grasp control framework that uses contact force feedback from all fingertip sensors simultaneously, allowing the hand to safely handle delicate objects even under external disturbances. This control framework is applied to several grasp-manipulation experiments: first, retaining a flexible cup in a grasp without crushing it under changes in object weight; second, a pouring task where the center of mass of the cup changes dynamically; and third, a tactile-driven leader-follower task where a human guides a held object. These manipulation tasks demonstrate more human-like dexterity with underactuated robotic hands by using fast reflexive control from tactile sensing.

**Title (ZH)**: Splat-LOAM：高斯插值 lidar 惯导里程计与建图 

**Authors**: Emanuele Giacomini, Luca Di Giammarino, Lorenzo De Rebotti, Giorgio Grisetti, Martin R. Oswald  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17491)  

**Abstract**: LiDARs provide accurate geometric measurements, making them valuable for ego-motion estimation and reconstruction tasks. Although its success, managing an accurate and lightweight representation of the environment still poses challenges. Both classic and NeRF-based solutions have to trade off accuracy over memory and processing times. In this work, we build on recent advancements in Gaussian Splatting methods to develop a novel LiDAR odometry and mapping pipeline that exclusively relies on Gaussian primitives for its scene representation. Leveraging spherical projection, we drive the refinement of the primitives uniquely from LiDAR measurements. Experiments show that our approach matches the current registration performance, while achieving SOTA results for mapping tasks with minimal GPU requirements. This efficiency makes it a strong candidate for further exploration and potential adoption in real-time robotics estimation tasks. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: LiDARs提供精确的几何测量，使其在自我运动估计和重建任务中具有重要价值。尽管取得了成功，但如何管理环境的准确且轻量级表示仍面临挑战。无论是经典的解决方案还是基于NeRF的方法，都需在准确性和内存消耗、处理时间之间进行权衡。在本工作中，我们基于最近在高斯细化方法方面的进展，开发了一种全新的基于高斯原语的LiDAR里程计和建图流水线。利用球面投影，我们仅从LiDAR测量中驱动原语的细化。实验结果显示，我们的方法在满足当前注册性能的同时，通过最小化的GPU需求实现了最先进的建图结果。这种效率使其成为实时机器人估计任务中进一步探索和潜在应用的有力候选者。

# Robust Tube-based Control Strategy for Vision-guided Autonomous Vehicles 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于视觉引导的自主车辆稳健管状控制策略 

**Authors**: Der-Hau Lee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18752)  

**Abstract**: A robust control strategy for autonomous vehicles can improve system stability, enhance riding comfort, and prevent driving accidents. This paper presents a novel interpolation tube-based constrained iterative linear quadratic regulator (itube-CILQR) algorithm for autonomous computer-vision-based vehicle lane-keeping. The goal of the algorithm is to enhance robustness during high-speed cornering on tight turns. The advantages of itube-CILQR over the standard tube-approach include reduced system conservatism and increased computational speed. Numerical and vision-based experiments were conducted to examine the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. The proposed itube-CILQR algorithm is better suited to vehicle lane-keeping than variational CILQR-based methods and model predictive control (MPC) approaches using a classical interior-point solver. Specifically, in evaluation experiments, itube-CILQR achieved an average runtime of 3.16 ms to generate a control signal to guide a self-driving vehicle; itube-MPC typically required a 4.67-times longer computation time to complete the same task. Moreover, the influence of conservatism on system behavior was investigated by exploring the interpolation variable trajectories derived from the proposed itube-CILQR algorithm during lane-keeping maneuvers.

**Title (ZH)**: 基于联合状态-参数观测器的无人机重载运输鲁棒控制 

**Authors**: Brenner S. Rego, Daniel N. Cardoso, Marco. H. Terra, Guilherme V. Raffo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.18187)  

**Abstract**: This paper proposes a joint state-parameter observer-based controller for trajectory tracking of an octocopter unmanned aerial vehicle (OUAV), for transportation of a heavy load with unknown mass and size. The multi-body dynamic model of the OUAV with a rigidly attached load is obtained, effectively considering the effects of the load parameters into the dynamics of the system. A robust nonlinear W-infinity control strategy is designed for optimal trajectory tracking of the OUAV, with information of the states and load parameters provided by a joint estimation unscented Kalman filter. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is corroborated by numerical results.

**Title (ZH)**: TamedPUMA：带有几何织构的安全稳定的模仿学习 

**Authors**: Saray Bakker, Rodrigo Pérez-Dattari, Cosimo Della Santina, Wendelin Böhmer, Javier Alonso-Mora  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.17432)  

**Abstract**: Using the language of dynamical systems, Imitation learning (IL) provides an intuitive and effective way of teaching stable task-space motions to robots with goal convergence. Yet, IL techniques are affected by serious limitations when it comes to ensuring safety and fulfillment of physical constraints. With this work, we solve this challenge via TamedPUMA, an IL algorithm augmented with a recent development in motion generation called geometric fabrics. As both the IL policy and geometric fabrics describe motions as artificial second-order dynamical systems, we propose two variations where IL provides a navigation policy for geometric fabrics. The result is a stable imitation learning strategy within which we can seamlessly blend geometrical constraints like collision avoidance and joint limits. Beyond providing a theoretical analysis, we demonstrate TamedPUMA with simulated and real-world tasks, including a 7-DoF manipulator. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 使用动力系统语言，模仿学习（IL）为通过目标收敛有效地向机器人教授稳定的空间任务运动提供了直观的方法。然而，当涉及到确保安全性和满足物理约束时，IL技术受到了严重限制。通过引入一种称为几何织物的运动生成 recent进展，我们提出了 TamedPUMA，一种增强的 IL 算法。由于 IL 策略和几何织物都将运动描述为人工的二阶动力系统，我们提出了两种变体，其中 IL 为几何织物提供导航策略。结果是一种稳定的模仿学习策略，在该策略中，我们可以无缝融合避障和关节限制等几何约束。除了提供理论分析外，我们还通过模拟和实际任务（包括一个 7 自由度 manipulating 机构）演示了 TamedPUMA。
