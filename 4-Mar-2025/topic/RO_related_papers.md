**Abstract**: Tactile sensing is essential for dexterous manipulation, yet large-scale human demonstration datasets lack tactile feedback, limiting their effectiveness in skill transfer to robots. To address this, we introduce TacCap, a wearable Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG)-based tactile sensor designed for seamless human-to-robot transfer. TacCap is lightweight, durable, and immune to electromagnetic interference, making it ideal for real-world data collection. We detail its design and fabrication, evaluate its sensitivity, repeatability, and cross-sensor consistency, and assess its effectiveness through grasp stability prediction and ablation studies. Our results demonstrate that TacCap enables transferable tactile data collection, bridging the gap between human demonstrations and robotic execution. To support further research and development, we open-source our hardware design and software.

# Soft Everting Prosthetic Hand and Comparison with Existing Body-Powered Terminal Devices 

**Title (ZH)**: 软 everting 截肢假手及其与现有体控终端装置的比较 

**Authors**: Gayoung Park, Katalin Schäffer, Margaret M. Coad  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01585)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we explore the use of a soft gripper, specifically a soft inverting-everting toroidal hydrostat, as a prosthetic hand. We present a design of the gripper integrated into a body-powered elbow-driven system and evaluate its performance compared to similar body-powered terminal devices: the Kwawu 3D-printed hand and the Hosmer hook. Our experiments highlight advantages of the Everting hand, such as low required cable tension for operation (1.6 N for Everting, 30.0 N for Kwawu, 28.1 N for Hosmer), limited restriction on the elbow angle range, and secure grasping capability (peak pulling force required to remove an object: 15.8 N for Everting, 6.9 N for Kwawu, 4.0 N for Hosmer). In our pilot user study, six able-bodied participants performed standardized hand dexterity tests. With the Everting hand compared to the Kwawu hand, users transferred more blocks in one minute and completed three tasks (moving small common objects, simulated feeding with a spoon, and moving large empty cans) faster (p~$\leq$~0.05). With the Everting hand compared to the Hosmer hook, users moved large empty cans faster (p~$\leq$~0.05) and achieved similar performance on all other tasks. Overall, user preference leaned toward the Everting hand for its adaptable grip and ease of use, although its abilities could be improved in tasks requiring high precision such as writing with a pen, and in handling heavier objects such as large heavy cans.

**Abstract**: Imitation learning has emerged as a powerful paradigm for robot skills learning. However, traditional data collection systems for dexterous manipulation face challenges, including a lack of balance between acquisition efficiency, consistency, and accuracy. To address these issues, we introduce Exo-ViHa, an innovative 3D-printed exoskeleton system that enables users to collect data from a first-person perspective while providing real-time haptic feedback. This system combines a 3D-printed modular structure with a slam camera, a motion capture glove, and a wrist-mounted camera. Various dexterous hands can be installed at the end, enabling it to simultaneously collect the posture of the end effector, hand movements, and visual data. By leveraging the first-person perspective and direct interaction, the exoskeleton enhances the task realism and haptic feedback, improving the consistency between demonstrations and actual robot deployments. In addition, it has cross-platform compatibility with various robotic arms and dexterous hands. Experiments show that the system can significantly improve the success rate and efficiency of data collection for dexterous manipulation tasks.

# Origami-Inspired Soft Gripper with Tunable Constant Force Output 

**Title (ZH)**: 受 Origami 启发的可调恒定力输出软夹持器 

**Authors**: Zhenwei Ni, Chang Xu, Zhihang Qin, Ceng Zhang, Zhiqiang Tang, Peiyi Wang, Cecilia Laschi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01481)  

**Abstract**: Soft robotic grippers gently and safely manipulate delicate objects due to their inherent adaptability and softness. Limited by insufficient stiffness and imprecise force control, conventional soft grippers are not suitable for applications that require stable grasping force. In this work, we propose a soft gripper that utilizes an origami-inspired structure to achieve tunable constant force output over a wide strain range. The geometry of each taper panel is established to provide necessary parameters such as protrusion distance, taper angle, and crease thickness required for 3D modeling and FEA analysis. Simulations and experiments show that by optimizing these parameters, our design can achieve a tunable constant force output. Moreover, the origami-inspired soft gripper dynamically adapts to different shapes while preventing excessive forces, with potential applications in logistics, manufacturing, and other industrial settings that require stable and adaptive operations

**Abstract**: Robotic manipulation within dynamic environments presents challenges to precise control and adaptability. Traditional fixed-view camera systems face challenges adapting to change viewpoints and scale variations, limiting perception and manipulation precision. To tackle these issues, we propose the Active Vision-driven Robotic (AVR) framework, a teleoperation hardware solution that supports dynamic viewpoint and dynamic focal length adjustments to continuously center targets and maintain optimal scale, accompanied by a corresponding algorithm that effectively enhances the success rates of various operational tasks. Using the RoboTwin platform with a real-time image processing plugin, AVR framework improves task success rates by 5%-16% on five manipulation tasks. Physical deployment on a dual-arm system demonstrates in collaborative tasks and 36% precision in screwdriver insertion, outperforming baselines by over 25%. Experimental results confirm that AVR framework enhances environmental perception, manipulation repeatability (40% $\le $1 cm error), and robustness in complex scenarios, paving the way for future robotic precision manipulation methods in the pursuit of human-level robot dexterity and precision.

# CAO-RONet: A Robust 4D Radar Odometry with Exploring More Information from Low-Quality Points 

**Title (ZH)**: CAO-RONet：一种从低质量点中探索更多信息的 robust 4D 雷达里程计 

**Authors**: Zhiheng Li, Yubo Cui, Ningyuan Huang, Chenglin Pang, Zheng Fang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01438)  

**Abstract**: Recently, 4D millimetre-wave radar exhibits more stable perception ability than LiDAR and camera under adverse conditions (e.g. rain and fog). However, low-quality radar points hinder its application, especially the odometry task that requires a dense and accurate matching. To fully explore the potential of 4D radar, we introduce a learning-based odometry framework, enabling robust ego-motion estimation from finite and uncertain geometry information. First, for sparse radar points, we propose a local completion to supplement missing structures and provide denser guideline for aligning two frames. Then, a context-aware association with a hierarchical structure flexibly matches points of different scales aided by feature similarity, and improves local matching consistency through correlation balancing. Finally, we present a window-based optimizer that uses historical priors to establish a coupling state estimation and correct errors of inter-frame matching. The superiority of our algorithm is confirmed on View-of-Delft dataset, achieving around a 50% performance improvement over previous approaches and delivering accuracy on par with LiDAR odometry. Our code will be available. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 近期，4D毫米波雷达在恶劣条件（如雨雾）下的感知能力比LiDAR和相机更稳定。然而，低质量的雷达点云妨碍了其应用，尤其是在需要密集和精确匹配的建图任务中。为了充分利用4D雷达的潜力，我们提出了一种基于学习的里程计框架，能够从有限和不确定的几何信息中估计稳健的 ego 运动。首先，对于稀疏的雷达点云，我们提出了一种局部补全方法来补充缺失的结构，并提供更密集的对齐指导方针。然后，利用上下文感知的多层次结构进行特征相似匹配，并通过相关性平衡提高局部匹配一致性。最后，我们提出了一种基于窗口的优化器，利用历史先验建立耦合状态估计，并纠正帧间匹配的误差。在Delft视角数据集上的实验表明，我们的算法性能提高了约50%，精度与LiDAR里程计相当。我们的代码将开源。

# RUSSO: Robust Underwater SLAM with Sonar Optimization against Visual Degradation 

**Title (ZH)**: RUSSO:  robust underwater SLAM with sonar optimization against visual degradation 

**Authors**: Shu Pan, Ziyang Hong, Zhangrui Hu, Xiandong Xu, Wenjie Lu, Liang Hu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01434)  

**Abstract**: Visual degradation in underwater environments poses unique and significant challenges, which distinguishes underwater SLAM from popular vision-based SLAM on the ground. In this paper, we propose RUSSO, a robust underwater SLAM system which fuses stereo camera, inertial measurement unit (IMU), and imaging sonar to achieve robust and accurate localization in challenging underwater environments for 6 degrees of freedom (DoF) estimation. During visual degradation, the system is reduced to a sonar-inertial system estimating 3-DoF poses. The sonar pose estimation serves as a strong prior for IMU propagation, thereby enhancing the reliability of pose estimation with IMU propagation. Additionally, we propose a SLAM initialization method that leverages the imaging sonar to counteract the lack of visual features during the initialization stage of SLAM. We extensively validate RUSSO through experiments in simulator, pool, and sea scenarios. The results demonstrate that RUSSO achieves better robustness and localization accuracy compared to the state-of-the-art visual-inertial SLAM systems, especially in visually challenging scenarios. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time fusing stereo camera, IMU, and imaging sonar to realize robust underwater SLAM against visual degradation. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 水下视觉退化给水下SLAM带来了独特的和重要的挑战，这也使得水下SLAM不同于陆地上的视觉SLAM。本文提出了一种鲁棒的水下SLAM系统RUSSO，该系统融合了立体相机、惯性测量单元（IMU）和成像声纳，以在挑战性的水下环境中实现六自由度（6DoF）的鲁棒和准确定位。在视觉退化时，系统被简化为一个声纳-IMU系统，用于估计三维姿态。声纳姿态估计为IMU姿态传播提供了强大的先验信息，从而增强了姿态估计的可靠性。此外，我们提出了一种利用成像声纳进行SLAM初始化的方法，以弥补视觉特征不足的问题。我们通过在仿真实验、泳池和海场景况下进行广泛验证，结果表明，RUSSO在鲁棒性和定位精度方面优于最先进的视觉-惯性SLAM系统，特别是在视觉挑战性场景中表现尤为显著。据我们所知，这是首次将立体相机、IMU和成像声纳融合以实现针对视觉退化的鲁棒水下SLAM。

# Flexible Exoskeleton Control Based on Binding Alignment Strategy and Full-arm Coordination Mechanism 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于绑定对齐策略与全臂协调机制的柔性外骨骼控制 

**Authors**: Chuang Cheng, Xinglong Zhang, Xieyuanli Chen, Wei Dai, Longwen Chen, Daoxun Zhang, Hui Zhang, Jie Jiang, Huimin Lu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01338)  

**Abstract**: In rehabilitation, powered, and teleoperation exoskeletons, connecting the human body to the exoskeleton through binding attachments is a common configuration. However, the uncertainty of the tightness and the donning deviation of the binding attachments will affect the flexibility and comfort of the exoskeletons, especially during high-speed movement. To address this challenge, this paper presents a flexible exoskeleton control approach with binding alignment and full-arm coordination. Firstly, the sources of the force interaction caused by donning offsets are analyzed, based on which the interactive force data is classified into the major, assistant, coordination, and redundant component categories. Then, a binding alignment strategy (BAS) is proposed to reduce the donning disturbances by combining different force data. Furthermore, we propose a full-arm coordination mechanism (FCM) that focuses on two modes of arm movement intent, joint-oriented and target-oriented, to improve the flexible performance of the whole exoskeleton control during high-speed motion. In this method, we propose an algorithm to distinguish the two intentions to resolve the conflict issue of the force component. Finally, a series of experiments covering various aspects of exoskeleton performance (flexibility, adaptability, accuracy, speed, and fatigue) were conducted to demonstrate the benefits of our control framework in our full-arm exoskeleton. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 康复、助力和远程操作外骨骼中，通过绑定附件将人体连接到外骨骼是一种常见的配置。然而，绑定附件紧固程度的不确定性和佩戴偏差将影响外骨骼的灵活性和舒适性，尤其是在高速运动时。为应对这一挑战，本文提出了一种具备绑定对齐和全臂协调的灵活外骨骼控制方法。首先，基于穿戴偏移引起的作用力来源分析，将交互作用力数据分类为主要、辅助、协调和冗余组件类别。然后，提出了一种绑定对齐策略（BAS）以通过结合不同力数据来减少穿戴干扰。此外，我们提出了一种全臂协调机制（FCM），专注于手臂运动意图的两种模式——关节导向和目标导向，以提高在高速运动过程中整个外骨骼控制的灵活性。在此方法中，我们提出了一种算法来区分这两种意图以解决力组件冲突问题。最后，进行了一系列覆盖外骨骼性能各个方面的实验（灵活性、适应性、准确性、速度和疲劳），以证明我们控制框架在全臂外骨骼中的优势。

**Authors**: An-Chi He, Jungsoo Park, Benjamin Beiter, Bhaben Kalita, Alexander Leonessa  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01271)  

**Abstract**: This work presents the design, build, control, and preliminary user data of a locomotion interface called ForceBot. It delivers lower-body haptic interaction in virtual reality (VR), enabling users to walk in VR while interacting with various simulated terrains. It utilizes two planar gantries to give each foot two degrees of freedom and passive heel-lifting motion. The design used motion capture data with dynamic simulation for ergonomic human-robot workspace and hardware selection. Its system framework uses open-source robotic software and pairs with a custom-built power delivery system that offers EtherCAT communication with a 1,000 Hz soft real-time computation rate. This system features an admittance controller to regulate physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) alongside a walking algorithm to generate walking motion and simulate virtual terrains. The system's performance is explored through three measurements that evaluate the relationship between user input force and output pHRI motion. Overall, this platform presents a unique approach by utilizing planar gantries to realize VR terrain interaction with an extensive workspace, reasonably compact footprint, and preliminary user data.

# Impact of Static Friction on Sim2Real in Robotic Reinforcement Learning 

**Title (ZH)**: 静态摩擦力对机器人强化学习中Sim2Real影响的研究 

**Authors**: Xiaoyi Hu, Qiao Sun, Bailin He, Haojie Liu, Xueyi Zhang, Chunpeng lu, Jiangwei Zhong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01255)  

**Abstract**: In robotic reinforcement learning, the Sim2Real gap remains a critical challenge. However, the impact of Static friction on Sim2Real has been underexplored. Conventional domain randomization methods typically exclude Static friction from their parameter space. In our robotic reinforcement learning task, such conventional domain randomization approaches resulted in significantly underperforming real-world models. To address this Sim2Real challenge, we employed Actuator Net as an alternative to conventional domain randomization. While this method enabled successful transfer to flat-ground locomotion, it failed on complex terrains like stairs. To further investigate physical parameters affecting Sim2Real in robotic joints, we developed a control-theoretic joint model and performed systematic parameter identification. Our analysis revealed unexpectedly high friction-torque ratios in our robotic joints. To mitigate its impact, we implemented Static friction-aware domain randomization for Sim2Real. Recognizing the increased training difficulty introduced by friction modeling, we proposed a simple and novel solution to reduce learning complexity. To validate this approach, we conducted comprehensive Sim2Sim and Sim2Real experiments comparing three methods: conventional domain randomization (without Static friction), Actuator Net, and our Static friction-aware domain randomization. All experiments utilized the Rapid Motor Adaptation (RMA) algorithm. Results demonstrated that our method achieved superior adaptive capabilities and overall performance.

# A Single Scale Doesn't Fit All: Adaptive Motion Scaling for Efficient and Precise Teleoperation 

**Title (ZH)**: 不是一成不变的尺度适用一切：自适应运动尺度化以实现高效的精确遥操作 

**Authors**: Jeonghyeon Yoon, Sanghyeok Park, Hyojae Park, Cholin Kim, Sihyeoung Park, Minho Hwang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01216)  

**Abstract**: Teleoperation is increasingly employed in environments where direct human access is difficult, such as hazardous exploration or surgical field. However, if the motion scale factor(MSF) intended to compensate for workspace-size differences is set inappropriately, repeated clutching operations and reduced precision can significantly raise cognitive load. This paper presents a shared controller that dynamically applies the MSF based on the user's intended motion scale. Inspired by human motor skills, the leader arm trajectory is divided into coarse(fast, large-range movements) and fine(precise, small-range movements), with three features extracted to train a fuzzy C-means(FCM) clustering model that probabilistically classifies the user's motion scale. Scaling the robot's motion accordingly reduces unnecessary repetition for large-scale movements and enables more precise control for fine operations. Incorporating recent trajectory data into model updates and offering user feedback for adjusting the MSF range and response speed allows mutual adaptation between user and system. In peg transfer experiments, compared to using a fixed single scale, the proposed approach demonstrated improved task efficiency(number of clutching and task completion time decreased 38.46% and 11.96% respectively), while NASA-TLX scores confirmed a meaningful reduction(58.01% decreased) in cognitive load. This outcome suggests that a user-intent-based motion scale adjustment can effectively enhance both efficiency and precision in teleoperation.

# Optimal Trajectory Planning for Cooperative Manipulation with Multiple Quadrotors Using Control Barrier Functions 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于控制屏障函数的多旋翼协同 manipulation 最优轨迹规划 

**Authors**: Arpan Pallar, Guanrui Li, Mrunal Sarvaiya, Giuseppe Loianno  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01096)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we present a novel trajectory planning algorithm for cooperative manipulation with multiple quadrotors using control barrier functions (CBFs). Our approach addresses the complex dynamics of a system in which a team of quadrotors transports and manipulates a cable-suspended rigid-body payload in environments cluttered with obstacles. The proposed algorithm ensures obstacle avoidance for the entire system, including the quadrotors, cables, and the payload in all six degrees of freedom (DoF). We introduce the use of CBFs to enable safe and smooth maneuvers, effectively navigating through cluttered environments while accommodating the system's nonlinear dynamics. To simplify complex constraints, the system components are modeled as convex polytopes, and the Duality theorem is employed to reduce the computational complexity of the optimization problem. We validate the performance of our planning approach both in simulation and real-world environments using multiple quadrotors. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in achieving obstacle avoidance and safe trajectory generation for cooperative transportation tasks.

# KineSoft: Learning Proprioceptive Manipulation Policies with Soft Robot Hands 

**Title (ZH)**: KineSoft: 学习基于软体手的本体感觉操作策略 

**Authors**: Uksang Yoo, Jonathan Francis, Jean Oh, Jeffrey Ichnowski  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01078)  

**Abstract**: Underactuated soft robot hands offer inherent safety and adaptability advantages over rigid systems, but developing dexterous manipulation skills remains challenging. While imitation learning shows promise for complex manipulation tasks, traditional approaches struggle with soft systems due to demonstration collection challenges and ineffective state representations. We present KineSoft, a framework enabling direct kinesthetic teaching of soft robotic hands by leveraging their natural compliance as a skill teaching advantage rather than only as a control challenge. KineSoft makes two key contributions: (1) an internal strain sensing array providing occlusion-free proprioceptive shape estimation, and (2) a shape-based imitation learning framework that uses proprioceptive feedback with a low-level shape-conditioned controller to ground diffusion-based policies. This enables human demonstrators to physically guide the robot while the system learns to associate proprioceptive patterns with successful manipulation strategies. We validate KineSoft through physical experiments, demonstrating superior shape estimation accuracy compared to baseline methods, precise shape-trajectory tracking, and higher task success rates compared to baseline imitation learning approaches. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 柔oad机器人手内在的安全性和适应性优势使其在与刚性系统相比时更具优势，但在开发灵巧操作技能方面仍面临挑战。尽管模仿学习对复杂操作任务充满前景，但传统方法因演示收集难题和无效的状态表示而在软系统上挣扎。我们提出KineSoft框架，该框架通过利用软机器人手的自然顺应性作为一种技能教学优势而非仅作为控制挑战，实现实操教学。KineSoft 的两个主要贡献是：(1) 内部应变传感阵列提供无遮挡的本体感受形状估计，以及 (2) 一种基于形状的模仿学习框架，该框架使用本体感受反馈和低级形状条件控制器来接地扩散基策略。这使人类示范者能够在物理上引导机器人，同时系统学习将本体感受模式与成功的操作策略联系起来。我们通过物理实验验证了KineSoft，展示了与基线方法相比更高的形状估计准确性、精确的形状轨迹跟踪能力以及更高的任务成功率。

# General Force Sensation for Tactile Robot 

**Title (ZH)**: 全身力感知的触觉机器人 

**Authors**: Zhuo Chen, Ni Ou, Xuyang Zhang, Zhiyuan Wu, Yongqiang Zhao, Yupeng Wang, Nathan Lepora, Lorenzo Jamone, Jiankang Deng, Shan Luo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.01058)  

**Abstract**: Robotic tactile sensors, including vision-based and taxel-based sensors, enable agile manipulation and safe human-robot interaction through force sensation. However, variations in structural configurations, measured signals, and material properties create domain gaps that limit the transferability of learned force sensation across different tactile sensors. Here, we introduce GenForce, a general framework for achieving transferable force sensation across both homogeneous and heterogeneous tactile sensors in robotic systems. By unifying tactile signals into marker-based binary tactile images, GenForce enables the transfer of existing force labels to arbitrary target sensors using a marker-to-marker translation technique with a few paired data. This process equips uncalibrated tactile sensors with force prediction capabilities through spatiotemporal force prediction models trained on the transferred data. Extensive experimental results validate GenForce's generalizability, accuracy, and robustness across sensors with diverse marker patterns, structural designs, material properties, and sensing principles. The framework significantly reduces the need for costly and labor-intensive labeled data collection, enabling the rapid deployment of multiple tactile sensors on robotic hands requiring force sensing capabilities.

# Detecting Heel Strike and toe off Events Using Kinematic Methods and LSTM Models 

**Title (ZH)**: 使用运动学方法和LSTM模型检测足跟打击和脚趾离地事件 

**Authors**: Longbin Zhang, Tsung-Lin Wu, Ananda Sidarta, Xiaoyue Yan, Prayook Jatesiktat, Kailun Yang, Wei Tech Ang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00794)  

**Abstract**: Accurate gait event detection is crucial for gait analysis, rehabilitation, and assistive technology, particularly in exoskeleton control, where precise identification of stance and swing phases is essential. This study evaluated the performance of seven kinematics-based methods and a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model for detecting heel strike and toe-off events across 4363 gait cycles from 588 able-bodied subjects. The results indicated that while the Zeni et al. method achieved the highest accuracy among kinematics-based approaches, other methods exhibited systematic biases or required dataset-specific tuning. The LSTM model performed comparably to Zeni et al., providing a data-driven alternative without systematic bias. These findings highlight the potential of deep learning-based approaches for gait event detection while emphasizing the need for further validation in clinical populations and across diverse gait conditions. Future research will explore the generalizability of these methods in pathological populations, such as individuals with post-stroke conditions and knee osteoarthritis, as well as their robustness across varied gait conditions and data collection settings to enhance their applicability in rehabilitation and exoskeleton control.

**Title (ZH)**: 基于3D打印皮肤和骨架一体单位的五指仿生软体手的发展 

**Authors**: Kazuhiro Miyama, Kento Kawaharazuka, Kei Okada, Masayuki Inaba  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00789)  

**Abstract**: Robot hands that imitate the shape of the human body have been actively studied, and various materials and mechanisms have been proposed to imitate the human body. Although the use of soft materials is advantageous in that it can imitate the characteristics of the human body's epidermis, it increases the number of parts and makes assembly difficult in order to perform complex movements. In this study, we propose a skin-skeleton integrated robot hand that has 15 degrees of freedom and consists of four parts. The developed robotic hand is mostly composed of a single flexible part produced by a 3D printer, and while it can be easily assembled, it can perform adduction, flexion, and opposition of the thumb, as well as flexion of four fingers.

**Abstract**: How to endow aerial robots with the ability to operate in close proximity remains an open problem. The core challenges lie in the propulsion system's dual-task requirement: generating manipulation forces while simultaneously counteracting gravity. These competing demands create dynamic coupling effects during physical interactions. Furthermore, rotor-induced airflow disturbances critically undermine operational reliability. Although fully-actuated unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) alleviate dynamic coupling effects via six-degree-of-freedom (6-DoF) force-torque decoupling, existing implementations fail to address the aerodynamic interference between drones and environments. They also suffer from oversized designs, which compromise maneuverability and limit their applications in various operational scenarios. To address these limitations, we present FLOAT Drone (FuLly-actuated cOaxial Aerial roboT), a novel fully-actuated UAV featuring two key structural innovations. By integrating control surfaces into fully-actuated systems for the first time, we significantly suppress lateral airflow disturbances during operations. Furthermore, a coaxial dual-rotor configuration enables a compact size while maintaining high hovering efficiency. Through dynamic modeling, we have developed hierarchical position and attitude controllers that support both fully-actuated and underactuated modes. Experimental validation through comprehensive real-world experiments confirms the system's functional capabilities in close-proximity operations. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 如何赋予无人机在近距离操作的能力仍是一个开放问题。核心挑战在于推进系统的双重任务需求：同时生成操作力和对抗重力。这些相互竞争的需求在物理交互过程中产生了动态耦合效应。此外，旋翼引起的气流干扰严重削弱了操作可靠性。尽管具有六自由度（6-DoF）力- torque解耦的全自主无人直升机（UAV）能够缓解动态耦合效应，但现有实现方式未能解决无人机与环境之间的气动干扰问题。它们还存在尺寸过大的问题，这影响了机动性并限制了在各种操作场景中的应用。为了解决这些局限性，我们提出了FLOAT无人机（全自主共轴飞行机器人），这是一种具有两项关键结构创新的全新全自主无人机。通过首次将控制表面集成到全自主系统中，我们显著减少了操作过程中的横向气流干扰。此外，共轴双旋翼配置实现了紧凑的尺寸并保持了高效的悬停效率。通过动态建模，我们开发了支持全自主和欠自主模式的分层位置和姿态控制器。综合实地实验验证了该系统在近距离操作中的功能能力。

# Safe Periodic Trochoidal Paths for Fixed-Wing UAVs in Confined Windy Environments 

**Title (ZH)**: 固定翼无人机在受限多风环境中安全周期 trochoidal 航线规划 

**Authors**: Jaeyoung Lim, David Rohr, Thomas Stastny, Roland Siegwart  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00706)  

**Abstract**: Due to their energy-efficient flight characteristics, fixed-wing type UAVs are useful robotic tools for long-range and duration flight applications in large-scale environments. However, flying fixed-wing UAV in confined environments, such as mountainous regions, can be challenging due to their limited maneuverability and sensitivity to uncertain wind conditions. In this work, we first analyze periodic trochoidal paths that can be used to define wind-aware terminal loitering states. We then propose a wind-invariant safe set of trochoidal paths along with a switching strategy for selecting the corresponding minimum-extent periodic path type. Finally, we show that planning with this minimum-extent set allows us to safely reach up to 10 times more locations in mountainous terrain compared to planning with a single, conservative loitering maneuver. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 由于其能效高的飞行特性，固定翼型无人机是大型环境中长距离和长时间飞行应用有用的 robotic 工具。然而，在山地等受限环境中飞行固定翼型无人机因其有限的机动性和对不确定风况的敏感性而具有挑战性。在此工作中，我们首先分析可用于定义风感知终端盘旋状态的周期性螺旋线路径。然后，我们提出一种风不变的安全周期性螺旋线路径集合以及相应的最小范围周期性路径类型的切换策略。最后，我们证明使用此最小范围集合进行规划能够在山地地形中安全地到达常规盘旋操作可达位置的多达10倍数量的位置。

# One-Shot Gesture Recognition for Underwater Diver-To-Robot Communication 

**Title (ZH)**: 一次性手势识别以实现水下 diver-to-机器人通信 

**Authors**: Rishikesh Joshi, Junaed Sattar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00676)  

**Abstract**: Reliable human-robot communication is essential for underwater human-robot interaction (U-HRI), yet traditional methods such as acoustic signaling and predefined gesture-based models suffer from limitations in adaptability and robustness. In this work, we propose One-Shot Gesture Recognition (OSG), a novel method that enables real-time, pose-based, temporal gesture recognition underwater from a single demonstration, eliminating the need for extensive dataset collection or model retraining. OSG leverages shape-based classification techniques, including Hu moments, Zernike moments, and Fourier descriptors, to robustly recognize gestures in visually-challenging underwater environments. Our system achieves high accuracy on real-world underwater data and operates efficiently on embedded hardware commonly found on autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), demonstrating its feasibility for deployment on-board robots. Compared to deep learning approaches, OSG is lightweight, computationally efficient, and highly adaptable, making it ideal for diver-to-robot communication. We evaluate OSG's performance on an augmented gesture dataset and real-world underwater video data, comparing its accuracy against deep learning methods. Our results show OSG's potential to enhance U-HRI by enabling the immediate deployment of user-defined gestures without the constraints of predefined gesture languages. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 可靠的 underwater 人类-机器人通信对于水下人类-机器人交互（U-HRI）至关重要，然而传统的声学信号和预定义手势模型方法在适应性和鲁棒性方面存在局限性。在本文中，我们提出了一次性手势识别（OSG），这是一种新型方法，能够在单次示范下实现水下基于姿态的时间手势识别，无需大量数据集收集或模型重新训练。OSG 利用基于形状分类的技术，包括 Hu 矩、Zernike 矩和傅里叶描述符，以在视觉挑战性的水下环境中稳健地识别手势。我们的系统在实际水下数据上实现了高精度，并在自主水下车辆（AUV）常见的嵌入式硬件上高效运行，展示了其在水下机器人上部署的可行性。与深度学习方法相比，OSG 是轻量级的、计算效率高且高度适应性强，使其成为潜水员到机器人通信的理想选择。我们使用增强手势数据集和真实水下视频数据评估了 OSG 的性能，并将其准确性与深度学习方法进行了比较。我们的结果表明，OSG 有可能通过使用户定义的手势能够立即部署而增强 U-HRI，从而摆脱预定义手势语言的限制。

# Safety-Critical Control for Robotic Manipulators using Collision Cone Control Barrier Functions 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于碰撞圆锥控制Barrier函数的安全关键控制方法用于机器人 manipulator 控制 

**Authors**: Lucas Almeida  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00623)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a comprehensive approach for the safety-critical control of robotic manipulators operating in dynamic environments. Building upon the framework of Control Barrier Functions (CBFs), we extend the collision cone methodology to formulate Collision Cone Control Barrier Functions (C3BFs) specifically tailored for manipulators. In our approach, safety constraints derived from collision cone geometry are seamlessly integrated with Cartesian impedance control to ensure compliant yet safe end-effector behavior. A Quadratic Program (QP)-based controller is developed to minimally modify the nominal control input to enforce safety. Extensive simulation experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in various dynamic scenarios.

# ATMO: An Aerially Transforming Morphobot for Dynamic Ground-Aerial Transition 

**Title (ZH)**: ATMO: 一种用于动态地面-空中转换的空中形态变换morphobot 

**Authors**: Ioannis Mandralis, Reza Nemovi, Alireza Ramezani, Richard M. Murray, Morteza Gharib  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00609)  

**Abstract**: Designing ground-aerial robots is challenging due to the increased actuation requirements which can lead to added weight and reduced locomotion efficiency. Morphobots mitigate this by combining actuators into multi-functional groups and leveraging ground transformation to achieve different locomotion modes. However, transforming on the ground requires dealing with the complexity of ground-vehicle interactions during morphing, limiting applicability on rough terrain. Mid-air transformation offers a solution to this issue but demands operating near or beyond actuator limits while managing complex aerodynamic forces. We address this problem by introducing the Aerially Transforming Morphobot (ATMO), a robot which transforms near the ground achieving smooth transition between aerial and ground modes. To achieve this, we leverage the near ground aerodynamics, uncovered by experimental load cell testing, and stabilize the system using a model-predictive controller that adapts to ground proximity and body shape. The system is validated through numerous experimental demonstrations. We find that ATMO can land smoothly at body postures past its actuator saturation limits by virtue of the uncovered ground-effect. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 基于空中变形的变形地面-空中机器人设计克服了因增加的驱动需求而导致的重量增加和移动效率降低的问题。通过将驱动器组合成多功能组并利用地面变形来实现不同的移动模式，形态机器人减轻了这一问题。然而，地面变形受到地面-车辆交互复杂性的限制，限制了其在崎岖地形上的应用。空中变形提供了解决方案，但需要在或接近驱动器极限条件下操作并管理复杂的气动力量。我们通过引入空中变形的形态机器人（ATMO），一种在近地面变形以实现空中和地面模式平滑过渡的机器人，解决了这一问题。我们利用实验荷重测试发现的近地面气动学，并利用适应地面接近度和机体形状的模型预测控制器来稳定系统。该系统通过多次实验演示进行了验证。我们发现，ATMO得益于发现的地效，可以在超过了驱动器饱和极限的机体姿态下平稳着陆。

# Dynamic Collision Avoidance Using VelocityObstacle-based Control Barrier Functions 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于速度障碍的控制障碍函数的动态碰撞 avoidance 控制 

**Authors**: Jihao Huang, Jun Zeng, Xuemin Chi, Koushil Sreenath, Zhitao Liu, Hongye Su  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00606)  

**Abstract**: Designing safety-critical controllers for acceleration-controlled unicycle robots is challenging, as control inputs may not appear in the constraints of control Lyapunov functions(CLFs) and control barrier functions (CBFs), leading to invalid controllers. Existing methods often rely on state-feedback-based CLFs and high-order CBFs (HOCBFs), which are computationally expensive to construct and fail to maintain effectiveness in dynamic environments with fast-moving, nearby obstacles. To address these challenges, we propose constructing velocity obstacle-based CBFs (VOCBFs) in the velocity space to enhance dynamic collision avoidance capabilities, instead of relying on distance-based CBFs that require the introduction of HOCBFs. Additionally, by extending VOCBFs using variants of VO, we enable reactive collision avoidance between robots. We formulate a safety-critical controller for acceleration-controlled unicycle robots as a mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP), integrating state-feedback-based CLFs for navigation and VOCBFs for collision avoidance. To enhance the efficiency of solving the MIQP, we split the MIQP into multiple sub-optimization problems and employ a decision network to reduce computational costs. Numerical simulations demonstrate that our approach effectively guides the robot to its target while avoiding collisions. Compared to HOCBFs, VOCBFs exhibit significantly improved dynamic obstacle avoidance performance, especially when obstacles are fast-moving and close to the robot. Furthermore, we extend our method to distributed multi-robot systems.

# Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets for Multi-Robot Motion Planning 

**Title (ZH)**: 凸集的时空图在多机器人运动规划中的应用 

**Authors**: Jingtao Tang, Zining Mao, Lufan Yang, Hang Ma  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00583)  

**Abstract**: We address the Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) problem of computing collision-free trajectories for multiple robots in shared continuous environments. While existing frameworks effectively decompose MRMP into single-robot subproblems, spatiotemporal motion planning with dynamic obstacles remains challenging, particularly in cluttered or narrow-corridor settings. We propose Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets (ST-GCS), a novel planner that systematically covers the collision-free space-time domain with convex sets instead of relying on random sampling. By extending Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) into the time dimension, ST-GCS formulates time-optimal trajectories in a unified convex optimization that naturally accommodates velocity bounds and flexible arrival times. We also propose Exact Convex Decomposition (ECD) to "reserve" trajectories as spatiotemporal obstacles, maintaining a collision-free space-time graph of convex sets for subsequent planning. Integrated into two prioritized-planning frameworks, ST-GCS consistently achieves higher success rates and better solution quality than state-of-the-art sampling-based planners -- often at orders-of-magnitude faster runtimes -- underscoring its benefits for MRMP in challenging settings.

# Dexterous Three-Finger Gripper based on Offset Trimmed Helicoids (OTHs) 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于偏移修剪螺旋面（OTHs）的灵巧三指 gripper 

**Authors**: Qinghua Guan, Hung Hon Cheng, Josie Hughes  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00574)  

**Abstract**: This study presents an innovative offset-trimmed helicoids (OTH) structure, featuring a tunable deformation center that emulates the flexibility of human fingers. This design significantly reduces the actuation force needed for larger elastic deformations, particularly when dealing with harder materials like thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU). The incorporation of two helically routed tendons within the finger enables both in-plane bending and lateral out-of-plane transitions, effectively expanding its workspace and allowing for variable curvature along its length. Compliance analysis indicates that the compliance at the fingertip can be fine-tuned by adjusting the mounting placement of the fingers. This customization enhances the gripper's adaptability to a diverse range of objects. By leveraging TPU's substantial elastic energy storage capacity, the gripper is capable of dynamically rotating objects at high speeds, achieving approximately 60 in just 15 milliseconds. The three-finger gripper, with its high dexterity across six degrees of freedom, has demonstrated the capability to successfully perform intricate tasks. One such example is the adept spinning of a rod within the gripper's grasp.

**Authors**: Hung Hon Cheng, Josie Hughes  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00514)  

**Abstract**: CAFEs (Collaborative Agricultural Floating End-effectors) is a new robot design and control approach to automating large-scale agricultural tasks. Based upon a cable driven robot architecture, by sharing the same roller-driven cable set with modular robotic arms, a fast-switching clamping mechanism allows each CAFE to clamp onto or release from the moving cables, enabling both independent and synchronized movement across the workspace. The methods developed to enable this system include the mechanical design, precise position control and a dynamic model for the spring-mass liked system, ensuring accurate and stable movement of the robotic arms. The system's scalability is further explored by studying the tension and sag in the cables to maintain performance as more robotic arms are deployed. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate the system's effectiveness in tasks including pick-and-place showing its potential to contribute to agricultural automation.

# Flying on Point Clouds with Reinforcement Learning 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于强化学习在点云上的飞行 

**Authors**: Guangtong Xu, Tianyue Wu, Zihan Wang, Qianhao Wang, Fei Gao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00496)  

**Abstract**: A long-cherished vision of drones is to autonomously traverse through clutter to reach every corner of the world using onboard sensing and computation. In this paper, we combine onboard 3D lidar sensing and sim-to-real reinforcement learning (RL) to enable autonomous flight in cluttered environments. Compared to vision sensors, lidars appear to be more straightforward and accurate for geometric modeling of surroundings, which is one of the most important cues for successful obstacle avoidance. On the other hand, sim-to-real RL approach facilitates the realization of low-latency control, without the hierarchy of trajectory generation and tracking. We demonstrate that, with design choices of practical significance, we can effectively combine the advantages of 3D lidar sensing and RL to control a quadrotor through a low-level control interface at 50Hz. The key to successfully learn the policy in a lightweight way lies in a specialized surrogate of the lidar's raw point clouds, which simplifies learning while retaining a fine-grained perception to detect narrow free space and thin obstacles. Simulation statistics demonstrate the advantages of the proposed system over alternatives, such as performing easier maneuvers and higher success rates at different speed constraints. With lightweight simulation techniques, the policy trained in the simulator can control a physical quadrotor, where the system can dodge thin obstacles and safely traverse randomly distributed obstacles.

# Bring Your Own Grasp Generator: Leveraging Robot Grasp Generation for Prosthetic Grasping 

**Title (ZH)**: 自带抓取生成器：利用机器人抓取生成技术进行假肢抓取 

**Authors**: Giuseppe Stracquadanio, Federico Vasile, Elisa Maiettini, Nicolò Boccardo, Lorenzo Natale  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00466)  

**Abstract**: One of the most important research challenges in upper-limb prosthetics is enhancing the user-prosthesis communication to closely resemble the experience of a natural limb. As prosthetic devices become more complex, users often struggle to control the additional degrees of freedom. In this context, leveraging shared-autonomy principles can significantly improve the usability of these systems. In this paper, we present a novel eye-in-hand prosthetic grasping system that follows these principles. Our system initiates the approach-to-grasp action based on user's command and automatically configures the DoFs of a prosthetic hand. First, it reconstructs the 3D geometry of the target object without the need of a depth camera. Then, it tracks the hand motion during the approach-to-grasp action and finally selects a candidate grasp configuration according to user's intentions. We deploy our system on the Hannes prosthetic hand and test it on able-bodied subjects and amputees to validate its effectiveness. We compare it with a multi-DoF prosthetic control baseline and find that our method enables faster grasps, while simplifying the user experience. Code and demo videos are available online at this https URL.

# Feasible Force Set Shaping for a Payload-Carrying Platform Consisting of Tiltable Multiple UAVs Connected Via Passive Hinge Joints 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于被动铰链关节连接的可倾斜多旋翼载荷平台的可行力分布形成功能研究 

**Authors**: Takumi Ito, Hayato Kawashima, Riku Funada, Mitsuji Sampei  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00341)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a method for shaping the feasible force set of a payload-carrying platform composed of multiple Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) and proposes a control law that leverages the advantages of this shaped force set. The UAVs are connected to the payload through passively rotatable hinge joints. The joint angles are controlled by the differential thrust produced by the rotors, while the total force generated by all the rotors is responsible for controlling the payload. The shape of the set of the total force depends on the tilt angles of the UAVs, which allows us to shape the feasible force set by adjusting these tilt angles. This paper aims to ensure that the feasible force set encompasses the required shape, enabling the platform to generate force redundantly -meaning in various directions. We then propose a control law that takes advantage of this redundancy.

# A Practical Sensing Interface for Exoskeleton Evaluation in Workplaces using Interface Forces 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于接口力的工作场所外骨骼评估实用传感接口 

**Authors**: Joshua Leong Wei Ren, Thomas M. Kwok  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00293)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a novel approach to evaluating back support exoskeletons (BSEs) in workplace settings addressing the limitations of traditional methods like electromyography (EMG), which are impractical due to their sensitivity to external disturbances and user sweat. Variability in BSE performance among users, often due to joint misalignment and anthropomorphic differences, can lead to discomfort and reduced effectiveness. To overcome these challenges, we propose integrating a compact load cell into the exoskeleton's thigh cuff. This small load cell provides precise force measurements without significantly altering the exoskeleton's kinematics or inertia, enabling real-time assessment of exoskeleton assistance in both laboratory and workplace environments, Experimental validation during load-lifting tasks demonstrated that the load cell effectively captures interface forces between the BSE and human subjects, showing stronger correlations with the user's muscle activity when the BSE provides effective assistance. This innovative sensing interface offers a stable, practical alternative to EMG and respiratory gas measurements, facilitating more accurate and convenient evaluation of BSE performance in real-world industrial and laboratory settings. The proposed method holds promise for enhancing the adoption and effectiveness of BSEs by providing reliable, real-time feedback on their assistance capabilities.

**Abstract**: Sewing garments using robots has consistently posed a research challenge due to the inherent complexities in fabric manipulation. In this paper, we introduce an intelligent robotic automation system designed to address this issue. By employing a patented technique that temporarily stiffens garments, we eliminate the traditional necessity for fabric modeling. Our methodological approach is rooted in a meticulously designed three-stage pipeline: first, an accurate pose estimation of the cut fabric pieces; second, a procedure to temporarily join fabric pieces; and third, a closed-loop visual servoing technique for the sewing process. Demonstrating versatility across various fabric types, our approach has been successfully validated in practical settings, notably with cotton material at the Bluewater Defense production line and denim material at Levi's research facility. The techniques described in this paper integrate robotic mechanisms with traditional sewing machines, devising a real-time sewing algorithm, and providing hands-on validation through a collaborative robot setup.

**Abstract**: Protecting and restoring forest ecosystems has become an important conservation issue. Although various robots have been used for field data collection to protect forest ecosystems, the complex terrain and dense canopy make the data collection less efficient. To address this challenge, an aerial platform with bio-inspired behaviour facilitated by a bio-inspired mechanism is proposed. The platform spends minimum energy during data collection by perching on tree branches. A raptor inspired vision algorithm is used to locate a tree trunk, and then a horizontal branch on which the platform can perch is identified. A tendon-driven mechanism inspired by bat claws which requires energy only for actuation, secures the platform onto the branch using the mechanism's passive compliance. Experimental results show that the mechanism can perform perching on branches ranging from 30 mm to 80 mm in diameter. The real-world tests validated the system's ability to select and adapt to target points, and it is expected to be useful in complex forest ecosystems.

**Abstract**: Tactile sensing and the manipulation of delicate objects are critical challenges in robotics. This study presents a vision-based magnetic-actuated whisker array sensor that integrates these functions. The sensor features eight whiskers arranged circularly, supported by an elastomer membrane and actuated by electromagnets and permanent magnets. A camera tracks whisker movements, enabling high-resolution tactile this http URL sensor's performance was evaluated through object classification and grasping experiments. In the classification experiment, the sensor approached objects from four directions and accurately identified five distinct objects with a classification accuracy of 99.17% using a Multi-Layer Perceptron model. In the grasping experiment, the sensor tested configurations of eight, four, and two whiskers, achieving the highest success rate of 87% with eight whiskers. These results highlight the sensor's potential for precise tactile sensing and reliable manipulation.

# CAMETA: Conflict-Aware Multi-Agent Estimated Time of Arrival Prediction for Mobile Robots 

**Title (ZH)**: CAMETA：冲突意识的多机器人预计到达时间预测模型 

**Authors**: Jonas le Fevre Sejersen, Erdal Kayacan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.00074)  

**Abstract**: This study presents the conflict-aware multi-agent estimated time of arrival (CAMETA) framework, a novel approach for predicting the arrival times of multiple agents in unstructured environments without predefined road infrastructure. The CAMETA framework consists of three components: a path planning layer generating potential path suggestions, a multi-agent ETA prediction layer predicting the arrival times for all agents based on the paths, and lastly, a path selection layer that calculates the accumulated cost and selects the best path. The novelty of the CAMETA framework lies in the heterogeneous map representation and the heterogeneous graph neural network architecture. As a result of the proposed novel structure, CAMETA improves the generalization capability compared to the state-of-the-art methods that rely on structured road infrastructure and historical data. The simulation results demonstrate the efficiency and efficacy of the multi-agent ETA prediction layer, with a mean average percentage error improvement of 29.5% and 44% when compared to a traditional path planning method (A *) which does not consider conflicts. The performance of the CAMETA framework shows significant improvements in terms of robustness to noise and conflicts as well as determining proficient routes compared to state-of-the-art multi-agent path planners.

**Abstract**: Online extrinsic calibration is crucial for building "power-on-and-go" moving platforms, like robots and AR devices. However, blindly performing online calibration for unobservable parameter may lead to unpredictable results. In the literature, extensive studies have been conducted on the extrinsic calibration between IMU and camera, from theory to practice. It is well-known that the observability of extrinsic parameter can be guaranteed under sufficient motion excitation. Furthermore, the impacts of degenerate motions are also investigated. Despite these successful analyses, we identify an issue regarding the existing observability conclusion. This paper focuses on the observability investigation for straight line motion, which is a common-seen and fundamental degenerate motion in applications. We analytically prove that pure translational straight line motion can lead to the unobservability of the rotational extrinsic parameter between IMU and camera (at least one degree of freedom). By correcting observability conclusion, our novel theoretical finding disseminate more precise principle to the research community and provide explainable calibration guideline for practitioners. Our analysis is validated by rigorous theory and experiments. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 在线外参标定对于构建“即开即用”移动平台（如机器人和AR设备）至关重要。然而，盲目进行不可观测参数的在线标定可能产生不可预测的结果。在文献中，IMU与相机之间外参标定的理论与实践研究已十分广泛。已知在充分的运动激励下，外参的可观测性可以得到保证。此外，退化运动的影响也得到了研究。尽管已有这些成功的分析，我们识别出现有可观测性结论中存在一个问题。本文专注于直线运动的可观测性研究，这是应用中常见且基本的退化运动。我们从理论上证明，纯平移直线运动会导致IMU与相机之间的旋转外参至少在一个自由度上的不可观测性。通过修正可观测性结论，我们的新理论发现向研究界传播了更加精确的原则，并为实践者提供了可解释的标定指南。我们的分析通过严格的理论与实验得到了验证。

# A Taxonomy for Evaluating Generalist Robot Policies

**Abstract**: Machine learning for robotics promises to unlock generalization to novel tasks and environments. Guided by this promise, many recent works have focused on scaling up robot data collection and developing larger, more expressive policies to achieve this. But how do we measure progress towards this goal of policy generalization in practice? Evaluating and quantifying generalization is the Wild West of modern robotics, with each work proposing and measuring different types of generalization in their own, often difficult to reproduce, settings. In this work, our goal is (1) to outline the forms of generalization we believe are important in robot manipulation in a comprehensive and fine-grained manner, and (2) to provide reproducible guidelines for measuring these notions of generalization. We first propose STAR-Gen, a taxonomy of generalization for robot manipulation structured around visual, semantic, and behavioral generalization. We discuss how our taxonomy encompasses most prior notions of generalization in robotics. Next, we instantiate STAR-Gen with a concrete real-world benchmark based on the widely-used Bridge V2 dataset. We evaluate a variety of state-of-the-art models on this benchmark to demonstrate the utility of our taxonomy in practice. Our taxonomy of generalization can yield many interesting insights into existing models: for example, we observe that current vision-language-action models struggle with various types of semantic generalization, despite the promise of pre-training on internet-scale language datasets. We believe STAR-Gen and our guidelines can improve the dissemination and evaluation of progress towards generalization in robotics, which we hope will guide model design and future data collection efforts.

**Abstract (ZH)**: 机器学习在机器人学中的应用有望解锁对新任务和环境的泛化能力。为实现这一目标，许多近期工作关注于扩大机器人数据收集规模，并开发更大、表达能力更强的策略。但在实践中，我们如何衡量向这一泛化目标的进程？评估和量化泛化能力在当今的机器人学领域是一片未开垦之地，每项研究都在其特有的、往往难以复现的环境中提出了和衡量不同的泛化类型。本文旨在（1）全面而细致地概述我们认为在机器人操作中重要的泛化形式，（2）提供可复现的指南来测量这些泛化的概念。我们首先提出STAR-Gen，这是一种基于视觉、语义和行为泛化的机器人操作泛化分类框架。我们讨论了该分类框架如何涵盖机器人学中大多数先前的泛化概念。接下来，我们基于广泛使用的Bridge V2数据集，以具体的现实世界基准实例化STAR-Gen。我们评估了一系列最新的模型在这一基准上的性能，以展示分类框架在实践中的效用。我们的泛化分类框架能揭示现有模型的许多有趣见解：例如，我们观察到当前的视觉-语言-动作模型在各种语义泛化方面存在困难，尽管这些模型在大规模互联网语言数据上进行了预训练。我们相信STAR-Gen和我们的指南能够提高机器人学中泛化进展的传播与评估，我们希望这能指导模型设计和未来的数据收集工作。我们的视频和演示可以在我们的网站 this http URL 上找到。
