**Abstract**: Robots can better interact with humans and unstructured environments through touch sensing. However, most commercial robots are not equipped with tactile skins, making it challenging to achieve even basic touch-sensing functions, such as contact localization. We present UniTac, a data-driven whole-body touch-sensing approach that uses only proprioceptive joint sensors and does not require the installation of additional sensors. Our approach enables a robot equipped solely with joint sensors to localize contacts. Our goal is to democratize touch sensing and provide an off-the-shelf tool for HRI researchers to provide their robots with touch-sensing capabilities. We validate our approach on two platforms: the Franka robot arm and the Spot quadruped. On Franka, we can localize contact to within 8.0 centimeters, and on Spot, we can localize to within 7.2 centimeters at around 2,000 Hz on an RTX 3090 GPU without adding any additional sensors to the robot.

**Abstract (ZH)**: 机器人通过触觉感知能够更好地与人类和未结构化环境互动。然而，大多数商用机器人并未配备触觉皮肤，使得实现基本的触觉感知功能，如接触定位，极具挑战性。我们提出了UniTac，一种基于数据的整体触觉感知方法，仅使用本体感受关节传感器，不需要安装额外传感器。该方法使仅配备关节传感器的机器人能够定位接触点。我们的目标是普及触觉感知，并为HRI研究人员提供一种即用型工具，以赋予其机器人触觉感知能力。我们在Franka机器人臂和Spot四足机器人上验证了该方法。在Franka上，我们可以将接触定位精度控制在8.0厘米以内；在Spot上，我们在RTX 3090 GPU上以约2000 Hz的频率将定位精度控制在7.2厘米以内，且无需向机器人添加额外传感器。项目网址：this https URL。

**Title (ZH)**: 基于光学跟踪的方法协作机器人辅助下颌角劈开截骨手术 

**Authors**: Zhe Han, Huanyu Tian, Tom Vercauteren, Da Liu, Changsheng Li, Xingguang Duan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07794)  

**Abstract**: Mandibular Angle Split Osteotomy (MASO) is a significant procedure in oral and maxillofacial surgery. Despite advances in technique and instrumentation, its success still relies heavily on the surgeon's experience. In this work, a human-robot collaborative system is proposed to perform MASO according to a preoperative plan and under guidance of a surgeon. A task decomposition methodology is used to divide the collaborative surgical procedure into three subtasks: (1) positional control and (2) orientation control, both led by the robot for precise alignment; and (3) force-control, managed by surgeon to ensure safety. Additionally, to achieve patient tracking without the need for a skull clamp, an optical tracking system (OTS) is utilized. Movement of the patient mandibular is measured with an optical-based tracker mounted on a dental occlusal splint. A registration method and Robot-OTS calibration method are introduced to achieve reliable navigation within our framework. The experiments of drilling were conducted on the realistic phantom model, which demonstrated that the average error between the planned and actual drilling points is 1.85mm.

# Distributed Surface Inspection via Operational Modal Analysis by a Swarm of Miniaturized Vibration-Sensing Robots 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于微型振动传感器机器人 swarm 的分布式表面检测方法研究via操作模态分析 

**Authors**: Thiemen Siemensma, Niels de Boer, Bahar Haghighat  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07724)  

**Abstract**: Robot swarms offer the potential to serve a variety of distributed sensing applications. An interesting real-world application that stands to benefit significantly from deployment of swarms is structural monitoring, where traditional sensor networks face challenges in structural coverage due to their static nature. This paper investigates the deployment of a swarm of miniaturized vibration sensing robots to inspect and localize structural damages on a surface section within a high-fidelity simulation environment. In particular, we consider a 1 m x 1 m x 3 mm steel surface section and utilize finite element analysis using Abaqus to obtain realistic structural vibration data. The resulting vibration data is imported into the physics-based robotic simulator Webots, where we simulate the dynamics of our surface inspecting robot swarm. We employ (i) Gaussian process estimators to guide the robots' exploration as they collect vibration samples across the surface and (ii) operational modal analysis to detect structural damages by estimating and comparing existing and intact structural vibration patterns. We analyze the influence of exploration radii on estimation uncertainty and assess the effectiveness of our method across 10 randomized scenarios, where the number, locations, surface area, and depth of structural damages vary. Our simulation studies validate the efficacy of our miniaturized robot swarm for vibration-based structural inspection.

**Authors**: Alberto Rota, Ke Fan, Elena De Momi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07718)  

**Abstract**: The integration of high-level assistance algorithms in surgical robotics training curricula may be beneficial in establishing a more comprehensive and robust skillset for aspiring surgeons, improving their clinical performance as a consequence. This work presents the development and validation of a haptic-enhanced Virtual Reality simulator for surgical robotics training, featuring 8 surgical tasks that the trainee can interact with thanks to the embedded physics engine. This virtual simulated environment is augmented by the introduction of high-level haptic interfaces for robotic assistance that aim at re-directing the motion of the trainee's hands and wrists toward targets or away from obstacles, and providing a quantitative performance score after the execution of each training this http URL experimental study shows that the introduction of enhanced robotic assistance into a surgical robotics training curriculum improves performance during the training process and, crucially, promotes the transfer of the acquired skills to an unassisted surgical scenario, like the clinical one.

# Adaptive Gaussian Mixture Models-based Anomaly Detection for under-constrained Cable-Driven Parallel Robots 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于自适应高斯混合模型的约束不足的缆驱动并联机器人异常检测 

**Authors**: Julio Garrido, Javier Vales, Diego Silva-Muñiz, Enrique Riveiro, Pablo López-Matencio, Josué Rivera-Andrade  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07714)  

**Abstract**: Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs) are increasingly used for load manipulation tasks involving predefined toolpaths with intermediate stops. At each stop, where the platform maintains a fixed pose and the motors keep the cables under tension, the system must evaluate whether it is safe to proceed by detecting anomalies that could compromise performance (e.g., wind gusts or cable impacts). This paper investigates whether anomalies can be detected using only motor torque data, without additional sensors. It introduces an adaptive, unsupervised outlier detection algorithm based on Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs) to identify anomalies from torque signals. The method starts with a brief calibration period, just a few seconds, during which a GMM is fit on known anomaly-free data. Real-time torque measurements are then evaluated using Mahalanobis distance from the GMM, with statistically derived thresholds triggering anomaly flags. Model parameters are periodically updated using the latest segments identified as anomaly-free to adapt to changing conditions. Validation includes 14 long-duration test sessions simulating varied wind intensities. The proposed method achieves a 100% true positive rate and 95.4% average true negative rate, with 1-second detection latency. Comparative evaluation against power threshold and non-adaptive GMM methods indicates higher robustness to drift and environmental variation.

**Title (ZH)**: FiDTouch：一种指腹3D触觉显示装置 

**Authors**: Daria Trinitatova, Dzmitry Tsetserukou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07661)  

**Abstract**: The applications of fingertip haptic devices have spread to various fields from revolutionizing virtual reality and medical training simulations to facilitating remote robotic operations, proposing great potential for enhancing user experiences, improving training outcomes, and new forms of interaction. In this work, we present FiDTouch, a 3D wearable haptic device that delivers cutaneous stimuli to the finger pad, such as contact, pressure, encounter, skin stretch, and vibrotactile feedback. The application of a tiny inverted Delta robot in the mechanism design allows providing accurate contact and fast changing dynamic stimuli to the finger pad surface. The performance of the developed display was evaluated in a two-stage user study of the perception of static spatial contact stimuli and skin stretch stimuli generated on the finger pad. The proposed display, by providing users with precise touch and force stimuli, can enhance user immersion and efficiency in the fields of human-computer and human-robot interactions.

# SCREP: Scene Coordinate Regression and Evidential Learning-based Perception-Aware Trajectory Generation 

**Title (ZH)**: SCREP：基于场景坐标回归和似真性学习的感知aware轨迹生成 

**Authors**: Juyeop Han, Lukas Lao Beyer, Guilherme V. Cavalheiro, Sertac Karaman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07467)  

**Abstract**: Autonomous flight in GPS denied indoor spaces requires trajectories that keep visual localization error tightly bounded across varied missions. Whereas visual inertial odometry (VIO) accumulates drift over time, scene coordinate regression (SCR) yields drift-free, high accuracy absolute pose estimation. We present a perception-aware framework that couples an evidential learning-based SCR pose estimator with a receding horizon trajectory optimizer. The optimizer steers the onboard camera toward pixels whose uncertainty predicts reliable scene coordinates, while a fixed-lag smoother fuses the low rate SCR stream with high rate IMU data to close the perception control loop in real time. In simulation, our planner reduces translation (rotation) mean error by 54% / 15% (40% / 31%) relative to yaw fixed and forward-looking baselines, respectively. Moreover, hardware in the loop experiment validates the feasibility of our proposed framework. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: GPS受限室内环境下的自主飞行要求保持视觉局部化误差在各种任务中紧密受限。我们提出了一种感知意识框架，该框架将基于证据学习的场景坐标回归（SCR）姿态估计器与展望型轨迹优化器耦合。优化器引导机载相机朝向不确定性预测可靠的场景坐标像素移动，同时固定延迟平滑器将低速率的SCR流与高率IMU数据融合，实现实时感知控制闭环。仿真结果显示，与固定的航向基准和前瞻基准相比，我们的规划者将平移（旋转）均方误差分别减少了54%/15%（40%/31%）。此外，硬件在环实验验证了我们所提框架的可行性。

# Towards Safe Autonomous Driving: A Real-Time Safeguarding Concept for Motion Planning Algorithms 

**Title (ZH)**: 面向安全自主驾驶：一种实时安全保护概念在运动规划算法中的应用 

**Authors**: Korbinian Moller, Rafael Neher, Marvin Seegert, Johannes Betz  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07444)  

**Abstract**: Ensuring the functional safety of motion planning modules in autonomous vehicles remains a critical challenge, especially when dealing with complex or learning-based software. Online verification has emerged as a promising approach to monitor such systems at runtime, yet its integration into embedded real-time environments remains limited. This work presents a safeguarding concept for motion planning that extends prior approaches by introducing a time safeguard. While existing methods focus on geometric and dynamic feasibility, our approach additionally monitors the temporal consistency of planning outputs to ensure timely system response. A prototypical implementation on a real-time operating system evaluates trajectory candidates using constraint-based feasibility checks and cost-based plausibility metrics. Preliminary results show that the safeguarding module operates within real-time bounds and effectively detects unsafe trajectories. However, the full integration of the time safeguard logic and fallback strategies is ongoing. This study contributes a modular and extensible framework for runtime trajectory verification and highlights key aspects for deployment on automotive-grade hardware. Future work includes completing the safeguarding logic and validating its effectiveness through hardware-in-the-loop simulations and vehicle-based testing. The code is available at: this https URL 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 确保自主车辆运动规划模块的功能安全仍是一项关键挑战，尤其是在处理复杂或基于学习的软件时。在线验证已 emerge as a promising approach to monitor such systems at runtime，但其在嵌入式实时环境中的集成仍受限。本研究提出了一种运动规划的安全保障概念，该概念扩展了先前的方法，通过引入时间保障来进一步保障。现有方法主要关注几何和动态可行性，而我们的方法还监控规划输出的时间一致性，以确保系统的及时响应。在实时操作系统上实现了一个原型，使用基于约束的可行性检查和基于成本的可行性度量来评估轨迹候选方案。初步结果表明，安全保障模块在实时界限内运行，并有效检测到不安全的轨迹。然而，时间保障逻辑和后备策略的全面集成仍在进行中。本研究提供了一个模块化和可扩展的实时轨迹验证框架，并强调了在汽车级硬件上部署的关键方面。未来的工作将完成安全保障逻辑，并通过硬件在环仿真和基于车辆的测试验证其有效性。相关代码可在以下链接获取：this https URL。

# Data-driven Kinematic Modeling in Soft Robots: System Identification and Uncertainty Quantification 

**Title (ZH)**: 软体机器人的数据驱动运动建模：系统辨识与不确定性量化 

**Authors**: Zhanhong Jiang, Dylan Shah, Hsin-Jung Yang, Soumik Sarkar  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07370)  

**Abstract**: Precise kinematic modeling is critical in calibration and controller design for soft robots, yet remains a challenging issue due to their highly nonlinear and complex behaviors. To tackle the issue, numerous data-driven machine learning approaches have been proposed for modeling nonlinear dynamics. However, these models suffer from prediction uncertainty that can negatively affect modeling accuracy, and uncertainty quantification for kinematic modeling in soft robots is underexplored. In this work, using limited simulation and real-world data, we first investigate multiple linear and nonlinear machine learning models commonly used for kinematic modeling of soft robots. The results reveal that nonlinear ensemble methods exhibit the most robust generalization performance. We then develop a conformal kinematic modeling framework for soft robots by utilizing split conformal prediction to quantify predictive position uncertainty, ensuring distribution-free prediction intervals with a theoretical guarantee. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 精确的动力学建模对于软机器人校准和控制器设计至关重要，但由于其高度非线性和复杂性行为，仍是一个具有挑战性的问题。为应对这一挑战，提出了多种数据驱动的机器学习方法来建模非线性动态。然而，这些模型 prediction 的不确定性可能会影响建模准确性，而软机器人动力学建模的不确定性量化尚未得到充分探索。在本工作中，我们利用有限的仿真和真实世界数据，首先研究了常用于软机器人动力学建模的多种线性和非线性机器学习模型。结果表明，非线性集成方法表现出最稳健的泛化性能。随后，我们通过利用分割一致性预测开发了一个软机器人的动力学建模框架，以量化预测位置的不确定性，并确保无分布假设的预测区间具有理论保证。

# Effects of Wrist-Worn Haptic Feedback on Force Accuracy and Task Speed during a Teleoperated Robotic Surgery Task 

**Title (ZH)**: 腕戴式触觉反馈对远程操作机器人手术任务中力量准确性及任务速度的影响 

**Authors**: Brian B. Vuong, Josie Davidson, Sangheui Cheon, Kyujin Cho, Allison M. Okamura  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07327)  

**Abstract**: Previous work has shown that the addition of haptic feedback to the hands can improve awareness of tool-tissue interactions and enhance performance of teleoperated tasks in robot-assisted minimally invasive surgery. However, hand-based haptic feedback occludes direct interaction with the manipulanda of surgeon console in teleoperated surgical robots. We propose relocating haptic feedback to the wrist using a wearable haptic device so that haptic feedback mechanisms do not need to be integrated into the manipulanda. However, it is unknown if such feedback will be effective, given that it is not co-located with the finger movements used for manipulation. To test if relocated haptic feedback improves force application during teleoperated tasks using da Vinci Research Kit (dVRK) surgical robot, participants learned to palpate a phantom tissue to desired forces. A soft pneumatic wrist-worn haptic device with an anchoring system renders tool-tissue interaction forces to the wrist of the user. Participants performed the palpation task with and without wrist-worn haptic feedback and were evaluated for the accuracy of applied forces. Participants demonstrated statistically significant lower force error when wrist-worn haptic feedback was provided. Participants also performed the palpation task with longer movement times when provided wrist-worn haptic feedback, indicating that the haptic feedback may have caused participants to operate at a different point in the speed-accuracy tradeoff curve. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 之前的研究表明，向外科医生的手中添加触觉反馈可以提高对手工器械与组织交互的意识，增强远程操作任务在机器人辅助微创手术中的性能。然而，基于手的触觉反馈遮挡了与外科医生控制台操作对象的直接交互。我们提出使用可穿戴触觉设备将触觉反馈移至腕部，从而使触觉反馈机制无需集成到操作对象中。然而，尚未清楚这种反馈是否有效，因为操作对象使用的是手指运动，而非腕部运动。为了测试在使用达芬奇研究套件（dVRK）手术机器人进行远程操作任务时，移位触觉反馈是否能改善力的应用，参与者学会了在施加所需力的同时 palpate 幻影组织。一种带有锚定系统的柔软气动可穿戴触觉设备将工具-组织交互力传递至用户的腕部。参与者在有和无腕部触觉反馈的情况下完成了 palpation 任务，并根据施加力的准确性进行了评估。结果表明，提供腕部触觉反馈时，参与者施加的力的误差显著降低。此外，提供腕部触觉反馈时，参与者完成 palpation 任务所需的时间更长，这表明触觉反馈可能使参与者在速度与准确性权衡曲线的不同点上操作。

# 3D Steering and Localization in Pipes and Burrows using an Externally Steered Soft Growing Robot 

**Title (ZH)**: 使用外部引导柔软生长机器人的管道和隧道中的三维转向与定位 

**Authors**: Yimeng Qin, Jared Grinberg, William Heap, Allison M. Okamura  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07225)  

**Abstract**: Navigation and inspection in confined environments, such as tunnels and pipes, pose significant challenges for existing robots due to limitations in maneuverability and adaptability to varying geometries. Vine robots, which are soft growing continuum robots that extend their length through soft material eversion at their tip, offer unique advantages due to their ability to navigate tight spaces, adapt to complex paths, and minimize friction. However, existing vine robot designs struggle with navigation in manmade and natural passageways, with branches and sharp 3D turns. In this letter, we introduce a steerable vine robot specifically designed for pipe and burrow environments. The robot features a simple tubular body and an external tip mount that steers the vine robot in three degrees of freedom by changing the growth direction and, when necessary, bracing against the wall of the pipe or burrow. Our external tip steering approach enables: (1) active branch selection in 3D space with a maximum steerable angle of 51.7°, (2) navigation of pipe networks with radii as small as 2.5 cm, (3) a compliant tip enabling navigation of sharp turns, and (4) real-time 3D localization in GPS-denied environments using tip-mounted sensors and continuum body odometry. We describe the forward kinematics, characterize steerability, and demonstrate the system in a 3D pipe system as well as a natural animal burrow.

**Abstract**: Robotic dressing assistance has the potential to improve the quality of life for individuals with limited mobility. Existing solutions predominantly rely on rigid robotic manipulators, which have challenges in handling deformable garments and ensuring safe physical interaction with the human body. Prior robotic dressing methods require excessive operation times, complex control strategies, and constrained user postures, limiting their practicality and adaptability. This paper proposes a novel soft robotic dressing system, the Self-Wearing Adaptive Garment (SWAG), which uses an unfurling and growth mechanism to facilitate autonomous dressing. Unlike traditional approaches,the SWAG conforms to the human body through an unfurling based deployment method, eliminating skin-garment friction and enabling a safer and more efficient dressing process. We present the working principles of the SWAG, introduce its design and fabrication, and demonstrate its performance in dressing assistance. The proposed system demonstrates effective garment application across various garment configurations, presenting a promising alternative to conventional robotic dressing assistance.

# Aerial Maritime Vessel Detection and Identification 

**Title (ZH)**: 空中海上船舶检测与识别 

**Authors**: Antonella Barisic Kulas, Frano Petric, Stjepan Bogdan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.07153)  

**Abstract**: Autonomous maritime surveillance and target vessel identification in environments where Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) are not available is critical for a number of applications such as search and rescue and threat detection. When the target vessel is only described by visual cues and its last known position is not available, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) must rely solely on on-board vision to scan a large search area under strict computational constraints. To address this challenge, we leverage the YOLOv8 object detection model to detect all vessels in the field of view. We then apply feature matching and hue histogram distance analysis to determine whether any detected vessel corresponds to the target. When found, we localize the target using simple geometric principles. We demonstrate the proposed method in real-world experiments during the MBZIRC2023 competition, integrated into a fully autonomous system with GNSS-denied navigation. We also evaluate the impact of perspective on detection accuracy and localization precision and compare it with the oracle approach. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 在全球导航卫星系统（GNSS）不可用的环境中实现自主 maritime 监视与目标船只识别对于搜救和威胁检测等应用至关重要。当目标船只仅通过视觉特征描述且其最后已知位置无法获得时，无人机必须在严格的计算约束下，仅依靠机载视觉扫描大面积搜索区域。为应对这一挑战，我们利用 YOLOv8 对象检测模型来检测视野中的所有船只。然后我们应用特征匹配和色调直方图距离分析来判断是否存在与目标相匹配的船只。找到目标后，我们使用简单的几何原理进行目标定位。我们在 2023 年 MBZIRC 竞赛中通过实际实验演示了所提出的方法，该方法整合到了一个具备 GNSS 禁用导航功能的完全自主系统中。我们还评估了视角对检测精度和定位精度的影响，并将其与最优方法进行了比较。
