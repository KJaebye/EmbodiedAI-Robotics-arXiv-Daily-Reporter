**Abstract**: We propose U-Arm, a low-cost and rapidly adaptable leader-follower teleoperation framework designed to interface with most of commercially available robotic arms. Our system supports teleoperation through three structurally distinct 3D-printed leader arms that share consistent control logic, enabling seamless compatibility with diverse commercial robot configurations. Compared with previous open-source leader-follower interfaces, we further optimized both the mechanical design and servo selection, achieving a bill of materials (BOM) cost of only \$50.5 for the 6-DoF leader arm and \$56.8 for the 7-DoF version. To enhance usability, we mitigate the common challenge in controlling redundant degrees of freedom by %engineering methods mechanical and control optimizations. Experimental results demonstrate that U-Arm achieves 39\% higher data collection efficiency and comparable task success rates across multiple manipulation scenarios compared with Joycon, another low-cost teleoperation interface. We have open-sourced all CAD models of three configs and also provided simulation support for validating teleoperation workflows. We also open-sourced real-world manipulation data collected with U-Arm. The project website is this https URL.

# Systematic Evaluation of Trade-Offs in Motion Planning Algorithms for Optimal Industrial Robotic Work Cell Design 

**Title (ZH)**: 运动规划算法在最优工业机器人工作站设计中的权衡系统评价 

**Authors**: G. de Mathelin, C. Hartl-Nesic, A. Kugi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02146)  

**Abstract**: The performance of industrial robotic work cells depends on optimizing various hyperparameters referring to the cell layout, such as robot base placement, tool placement, and kinematic design. Achieving this requires a bilevel optimization approach, where the high-level optimization adjusts these hyperparameters, and the low-level optimization computes robot motions. However, computing the optimal robot motion is computationally infeasible, introducing trade-offs in motion planning to make the problem tractable. These trade-offs significantly impact the overall performance of the bilevel optimization, but their effects still need to be systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce metrics to assess these trade-offs regarding optimality, time gain, robustness, and consistency. Through extensive simulation studies, we investigate how simplifications in motion-level optimization affect the high-level optimization outcomes, balancing computational complexity with solution quality. The proposed algorithms are applied to find the time-optimal kinematic design for a modular robot in two palletization scenarios. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 工业机器人工作单元的性能取决于优化各种超参数，如单元布局、机器人基座位置、工具位置和 kinematic 设计。这需要一种多层次优化方法，其中高层优化调整这些超参数，低层优化计算机器人运动。然而，计算最优的机器人运动在计算上是不可行的，引入了在运动规划中进行权衡以使问题可解。这些权衡显著影响多层次优化的整体性能，但它们的影响仍需要系统评估。在本文中，我们引入了评估这些权衡的指标，包括最优性、时间增益、鲁棒性和一致性。通过广泛的研究模拟，我们探讨了在运动层优化中进行简化的效果，平衡计算复杂度与解的质量。所提出的算法应用于在两种装盘场景下找到模块化机器人的时间最优 kinematic 设计。

# Learning Social Heuristics for Human-Aware Path Planning 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于社会启发式的面向人类路径规划 

**Authors**: Andrea Eirale, Matteo Leonetti, Marcello Chiaberge  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02134)  

**Abstract**: Social robotic navigation has been at the center of numerous studies in recent years. Most of the research has focused on driving the robotic agent along obstacle-free trajectories, respecting social distances from humans, and predicting their movements to optimize navigation. However, in order to really be socially accepted, the robots must be able to attain certain social norms that cannot arise from conventional navigation, but require a dedicated learning process. We propose Heuristic Planning with Learned Social Value (HPLSV), a method to learn a value function encapsulating the cost of social navigation, and use it as an additional heuristic in heuristic-search path planning. In this preliminary work, we apply the methodology to the common social scenario of joining a queue of people, with the intention of generalizing to further human activities. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 社会机器人导航在近年来的研究中处于中心地位。大多数研究集中在引导机器人沿无障碍轨迹行驶，遵守与人类的社会距离，并预测人类的移动以优化导航。然而，为了真正被社会接受，机器人必须具备某些不能通过传统导航获得的社会规范，而需要一个专门的学习过程。我们提出了一种启发式规划与学习的社会价值方法（HPLSV），用于学习一个包含社会导航成本的价值函数，并将其用作启发式搜索路径规划中的附加启发式方法。在本初步工作中，我们将该方法应用于人们常见的排队场景，旨在进一步推广到更多的人类活动。

# A Geometric Method for Base Parameter Analysis in Robot Inertia Identification Based on Projective Geometric Algebra 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于射影几何代数的机器人惯性参数基元分析的几何方法 

**Authors**: Guangzhen Sun, Ye Ding, Xiangyang Zhu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02071)  

**Abstract**: This paper proposes a novel geometric method for analytically determining the base inertial parameters of robotic systems. The rigid body dynamics is reformulated using projective geometric algebra, leading to a new identification model named ``tetrahedral-point (TP)" model. Based on the rigid body TP model, coefficients in the regresoor matrix of the identification model are derived in closed-form, exhibiting clear geometric interpretations. Building directly from the dynamic model, three foundational principles for base parameter analysis are proposed: the shared points principle, fixed points principle, and planar rotations principle. With these principles, algorithms are developed to automatically determine all the base parameters. The core algorithm, referred to as Dynamics Regressor Nullspace Generator (DRNG), achieves $O(1)$-complexity theoretically following an $O(N)$-complexity preprocessing stage, where $N$ is the number of rigid bodies. The proposed method and algorithms are validated across four robots: Puma560, Unitree Go2, a 2RRU-1RRS parallel kinematics mechanism (PKM), and a 2PRS-1PSR PKM. In all cases, the algorithms successfully identify the complete set of base parameters. Notably, the approach demonstrates high robustness and computational efficiency, particularly in the cases of PKMs. Through the comprehensive demonstrations, the method is shown to be general, robust, and efficient.

# Generalizing Unsupervised Lidar Odometry Model from Normal to Snowy Weather Conditions 

**Title (ZH)**: 从普通天气条件到雪天条件的无监督激光里程计模型泛化研究 

**Authors**: Beibei Zhou, Zhiyuan Zhang, Zhenbo Song, Jianhui Guo, Hui Kong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.02011)  

**Abstract**: Deep learning-based LiDAR odometry is crucial for autonomous driving and robotic navigation, yet its performance under adverse weather, especially snowfall, remains challenging. Existing models struggle to generalize across conditions due to sensitivity to snow-induced noise, limiting real-world use. In this work, we present an unsupervised LiDAR odometry model to close the gap between clear and snowy weather conditions. Our approach focuses on effective denoising to mitigate the impact of snowflake noise and outlier points on pose estimation, while also maintaining computational efficiency for real-time applications.
To achieve this, we introduce a Patch Spatial Measure (PSM) module that evaluates the dispersion of points within each patch, enabling effective detection of sparse and discrete noise.
We further propose a Patch Point Weight Predictor (PPWP) to assign adaptive point-wise weights, enhancing their discriminative capacity within local regions. To support real-time performance, we first apply an intensity threshold mask to quickly suppress dense snowflake clusters near the LiDAR, and then perform multi-modal feature fusion to refine the point-wise weight prediction, improving overall robustness under adverse weather. Our model is trained in clear weather conditions and rigorously tested across various scenarios, including snowy and dynamic. Extensive experimental results confirm the effectiveness of our method, demonstrating robust performance in both clear and snowy weather. This advancement enhances the model's generalizability and paves the way for more reliable autonomous systems capable of operating across a wider range of environmental conditions. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 基于深度学习的LiDAR里程计对于自动驾驶和机器人导航至关重要，但在恶劣天气尤其是雪天下的性能仍具挑战性。现有模型由于对雪诱导噪声的敏感性难以在不同条件下泛化，限制了其在实际中的应用。本文提出了一种无监督的LiDAR里程计模型，以缩小晴天和雪天条件之间的差距。该方法重点在于有效的去噪，以减轻雪花噪声和离群点对姿态估计的影响，同时保持对实时应用的计算效率。

为此，我们引入了补丁空间度量（PSM）模块，该模块评估每个补丁内点的分散度，以有效检测稀疏且离散的噪声。

我们还提出了补丁点权重预测器（PPWP），以分配自适应的点权重，增强其在局部区域的判别能力。为支持实时性能，我们首先应用强度阈值掩码快速抑制LiDAR附近的密集雪花簇，然后进行多模态特征融合以细化点权重预测，从而在恶劣天气下提高整体鲁棒性。我们的模型在晴朗天气条件下训练，并在各种场景下进行严格的测试，包括雪天和动态场景。广泛的实验结果证实了该方法的有效性，展示了模型在晴天和雪天条件下的稳健性能。这一进展提升了模型的泛化能力，并为在更广泛环境条件下运行的更可靠自主系统铺平了道路。

# Geometric Control of Mechanical Systems with Symmetries Based on Sliding Modes 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于滑模的具有对称性的机械系统几何控制 

**Authors**: Eduardo Espindola, Yu Tang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01985)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we propose a framework for designing sliding mode controllers for a class of mechanical systems with symmetry, both unconstrained and constrained, that evolve on principal fiber bundles. Control laws are developed based on the reduced motion equations by exploring symmetries, leading to a sliding mode control strategy where the reaching stage is executed on the base space, and the sliding stage is performed on the structure group. Thus, design complexity is reduced, and difficult choices for coordinate representations when working with a particular Lie group are avoided. For this purpose, a sliding subgroup is constructed on the structure group based on a kinematic controller, and the sliding variable will converge to the identity of the state manifold upon reaching the sliding subgroup. A reaching law based on a general sliding vector field is then designed on the base space using the local form of the mechanical connection to drive the sliding variable to the sliding subgroup, and its time evolution is given according to the appropriate covariant derivative. Almost global asymptotic stability and local exponential stability are demonstrated using a Lyapunov analysis. We apply the results to a fully actuated system (a rigid spacecraft actuated by reaction wheels) and a subactuated nonholonomic system (unicycle mobile robot actuated by wheels), which is also simulated for illustration. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 本文提出了一类在主纤维丛上运动的对称机械系统滑模控制器设计框架，包括无约束和受约束系统。基于运动方程的降维并通过利用对称性开发控制律，提出了一种滑模控制策略，在基空间执行到达阶段，在结构群上执行滑模阶段，从而降低了设计复杂性，避免了在特定李群下使用特定坐标表示时的困难选择。为此，基于动力学控制器构造滑动子群，到达滑动子群后，滑动变量收敛于状态流形上的单位元。利用机械联络的局部形式在基空间设计基于通用滑动向量场的到达定律，驱动滑动变量到达滑动子群，并根据适当的协变导数给出其时间演变。通过李雅普unov分析证明了几乎全局渐近稳定性和局部指数稳定性。将结果应用于完全驱动系统（由反应轮驱动的刚体航天器）和部分驱动非完整系统（由车轮驱动的单轨移动机器人），并进行了仿真以进行说明。

**Title (ZH)**: 未来火星科学旋翼机的混合自主体系架构 

**Authors**: Luca Di Pierno, Robert Hewitt, Stephan Weiss, Roland Brockers  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01980)  

**Abstract**: Autonomous aerial vehicles, such as NASA's Ingenuity, enable rapid planetary surface exploration beyond the reach of ground-based robots. Thus, NASA is studying a Mars Science Helicopter (MSH), an advanced concept capable of performing long-range science missions and autonomously navigating challenging Martian terrain. Given significant Earth-Mars communication delays and mission complexity, an advanced autonomy framework is required to ensure safe and efficient operation by continuously adapting behavior based on mission objectives and real-time conditions, without human intervention. This study presents a deterministic high-level control framework for aerial exploration, integrating a Finite State Machine (FSM) with Behavior Trees (BTs) to achieve a scalable, robust, and computationally efficient autonomy solution for critical scenarios like deep space exploration. In this paper we outline key capabilities of a possible MSH and detail the FSM-BT hybrid autonomy framework which orchestrates them to achieve the desired objectives. Monte Carlo simulations and real field tests validate the framework, demonstrating its robustness and adaptability to both discrete events and real-time system feedback. These inputs trigger state transitions or dynamically adjust behavior execution, enabling reactive and context-aware responses. The framework is middleware-agnostic, supporting integration with systems like F-Prime and extending beyond aerial robotics. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 自主飞行器如NASA的Ingenuity使超越地面机器人范围的行星表面快速探索成为可能。因此，NASA正在研究火星科学旋翼飞机（MSH）这一先进概念，该概念能够执行远程科学任务并自主导航火星复杂地形。鉴于地火通信延迟和任务的复杂性，需要一个高级自主框架，以在不依赖人类干预的情况下，根据任务目标和实时条件持续适应行为，确保安全高效的操作。本文提出了一种确定性的高层控制框架，用于空中探索，将有限状态机（FSM）与行为树（BTs）结合，以实现适用于关键场景（如深空探索）的可扩展、可靠且计算高效的自主解决方案。本文概述了一种可能的MSH的关键能力，并详细描述了FSM-BT混合自主框架，该框架协调这些能力以实现 desired 目标。蒙特卡洛模拟和实地测试验证了该框架，证明了其对离散事件和实时系统反馈的高度稳健性和适应性。这些输入触发状态转换或动态调整行为执行，实现反应性和上下文感知的响应。该框架是一种中间件agnostic，支持与F-Prime等系统集成，并超越空中机器人领域。

# Novel bio-inspired soft actuators for upper-limb exoskeletons: design, fabrication and feasibility study 

**Title (ZH)**: 仿生启发的新型软执行器设计、制造及其在上肢外骨骼中的可行性研究 

**Authors**: Haiyun Zhang, Gabrielle Naquila, Jung Hyun Bae, Zonghuan Wu, Ashwin Hingwe, Ashish Deshpande  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01145)  

**Abstract**: Soft robots have been increasingly utilized as sophisticated tools in physical rehabilitation, particularly for assisting patients with neuromotor impairments. However, many soft robotics for rehabilitation applications are characterized by limitations such as slow response times, restricted range of motion, and low output force. There are also limited studies on the precise position and force control of wearable soft actuators. Furthermore, not many studies articulate how bellow-structured actuator designs quantitatively contribute to the robots' capability. This study introduces a paradigm of upper limb soft actuator design. This paradigm comprises two actuators: the Lobster-Inspired Silicone Pneumatic Robot (LISPER) for the elbow and the Scallop-Shaped Pneumatic Robot (SCASPER) for the shoulder. LISPER is characterized by higher bandwidth, increased output force/torque, and high linearity. SCASPER is characterized by high output force/torque and simplified fabrication processes. Comprehensive analytical models that describe the relationship between pressure, bending angles, and output force for both actuators were presented so the geometric configuration of the actuators can be set to modify the range of motion and output forces. The preliminary test on a dummy arm is conducted to test the capability of the actuators. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 软体机器人在物理康复中的应用越来越广泛， Particularly for 助残神经肌肉功能障碍患者的辅助治疗。然而，许多康复应用中的软体机器人受到响应时间缓慢、活动范围受限和输出力低等限制。此外，关于可穿戴软执行器的精确位置和力控制的研究也比较有限。同时，很少有研究明确阐述Bellows结构执行器设计如何定量提升机器人的能力。本研究引入了上肢软执行器的设计范式。该范式包括两个执行器：以龙虾为灵感的硅气动机器人（Lobster-Inspired Silicone Pneumatic Robot, LISPER）用于肘部，以及扇贝形气动机器人（Scallop-Shaped Pneumatic Robot, SCASPER）用于肩部。LISPER具有更高的带宽、更大的输出力/扭矩和高线性度。SCASPER具有更大的输出力/扭矩和简化了的制造工艺。两种执行器之间的压力、弯曲角度和输出力的关系的全面分析模型被提出，以便通过调整执行器的几何配置来修改活动范围和输出力。初步测试在假肢上进行，以测试执行器的能力。

# A novel parameter estimation method for pneumatic soft hand control applying logarithmic decrement for pseudo rigid body modeling 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于对数 decrement 的伪刚体建模的新型气动软手控制参数估计方法 

**Authors**: Haiyun Zhang, Kelvin HoLam Heung, Gabrielle J. Naquila, Ashwin Hingwe, Ashish D. Deshpande  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01113)  

**Abstract**: The rapid advancement in physical human-robot interaction (HRI) has accelerated the development of soft robot designs and controllers. Controlling soft robots, especially soft hand grasping, is challenging due to their continuous deformation, motivating the use of reduced model-based controllers for real-time dynamic performance. Most existing models, however, suffer from computational inefficiency and complex parameter identification, limiting their real-time applicability. To address this, we propose a paradigm coupling Pseudo-Rigid Body Modeling with the Logarithmic Decrement Method for parameter estimation (PRBM plus LDM). Using a soft robotic hand test bed, we validate PRBM plus LDM for predicting position and force output from pressure input and benchmark its performance. We then implement PRBM plus LDM as the basis for closed-loop position and force controllers. Compared to a simple PID controller, the PRBM plus LDM position controller achieves lower error (average maximum error across all fingers: 4.37 degrees versus 20.38 degrees). For force control, PRBM plus LDM outperforms constant pressure grasping in pinching tasks on delicate objects: potato chip 86 versus 82.5, screwdriver 74.42 versus 70, brass coin 64.75 versus 35. These results demonstrate PRBM plus LDM as a computationally efficient and accurate modeling technique for soft actuators, enabling stable and flexible grasping with precise force regulation.

# Model Predictive Control for a Soft Robotic Finger with Stochastic Behavior based on Fokker-Planck Equation 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于Fokker-Planck方程的具有随机行为软机器人手指的模型预测控制 

**Authors**: Sumitaka Honji, Takahiro Wada  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01065)  

**Abstract**: The inherent flexibility of soft robots offers numerous advantages, such as enhanced adaptability and improved safety. However, this flexibility can also introduce challenges regarding highly uncertain and nonlinear motion. These challenges become particularly problematic when using open-loop control methods, which lack a feedback mechanism and are commonly employed in soft robot control. Though one potential solution is model-based control, typical deterministic models struggle with uncertainty as mentioned above. The idea is to use the Fokker-Planck Equation (FPE), a master equation of a stochastic process, to control not the state of soft robots but the probabilistic distribution. In this study, we propose and implement a stochastic-based control strategy, termed FPE-based Model Predictive Control (FPE-MPC), for a soft robotic finger. Two numerical simulation case studies examine the performance and characteristics of this control method, revealing its efficacy in managing the uncertainty inherent in soft robotic systems. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 软体机器人内在的柔韧性提供了诸多优势，如增强的适应性和提高的安全性。然而，这种柔韧性也可能引入高度不确定性和非线性运动的挑战。这些挑战在使用开环控制方法时尤为突出，这类方法缺乏反馈机制，常被用于软体机器人控制中。尽管一种潜在的解决方案是基于模型的控制，但典型的确定性模型难以处理上述的不确定性。本研究提出并实现了基于随机性的控制策略，称为Fokker-Planck方程（FPE）为基础的模型预测控制（FPE-MPC），应用于软体机器人手指。通过两个数值仿真案例研究，探讨了该控制方法的性能和特性，展示了其在管理软体机器人系统固有的不确定性方面的有效性。

# A Reactive Grasping Framework for Multi-DoF Grippers via Task Space Velocity Fields and Joint Space QP 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于任务空间速度场和关节空间QP的多自由度抓取框架 

**Authors**: Yonghyeon Lee, Tzu-Yuan Lin, Alexander Alexiev, Sangbae Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01044)  

**Abstract**: We present a fast and reactive grasping framework for multi-DoF grippers that combines task-space velocity fields with a joint-space Quadratic Program (QP) in a hierarchical structure. Reactive, collision-free global motion planning is particularly challenging for high-DoF systems, since simultaneous increases in state dimensionality and planning horizon trigger a combinatorial explosion of the search space, making real-time planning intractable. To address this, we plan globally in a lower-dimensional task space, such as fingertip positions, and track locally in the full joint space while enforcing all constraints. This approach is realized by constructing velocity fields in multiple task-space coordinates (or in some cases a subset of joint coordinates) and solving a weighted joint-space QP to compute joint velocities that track these fields with appropriately assigned priorities. Through simulation experiments with privileged knowledge and real-world tests using the recent pose-tracking algorithm FoundationPose, we verify that our method enables high-DoF arm-hand systems to perform real-time, collision-free reaching motions while adapting to dynamic environments and external disturbances.

# One-Step Model Predictive Path Integral for Manipulator Motion Planning Using Configuration Space Distance Fields 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于配置空间距离场的一步模型预测路径积分用于 manipulator 运动规划 

**Authors**: Yulin Li, Tetsuro Miyazaki, Kenji Kawashima  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00836)  

**Abstract**: Motion planning for robotic manipulators is a fundamental problem in robotics. Classical optimization-based methods typically rely on the gradients of signed distance fields (SDFs) to impose collision-avoidance constraints. However, these methods are susceptible to local minima and may fail when the SDF gradients vanish. Recently, Configuration Space Distance Fields (CDFs) have been introduced, which directly model distances in the robot's configuration space. Unlike workspace SDFs, CDFs are differentiable almost everywhere and thus provide reliable gradient information. On the other hand, gradient-free approaches such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control leverage long-horizon rollouts to achieve collision avoidance. While effective, these methods are computationally expensive due to the large number of trajectory samples, repeated collision checks, and the difficulty of designing cost functions with heterogeneous physical units. In this paper, we propose a framework that integrates CDFs with MPPI to enable direct navigation in the robot's configuration space. Leveraging CDF gradients, we unify the MPPI cost in joint-space and reduce the horizon to one step, substantially cutting computation while preserving collision avoidance in practice. We demonstrate that our approach achieves nearly 100% success rates in 2D environments and consistently high success rates in challenging 7-DOF Franka manipulator simulations with complex obstacles. Furthermore, our method attains control frequencies exceeding 750 Hz, substantially outperforming both optimization-based and standard MPPI baselines. These results highlight the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed CDF-MPPI framework for high-dimensional motion planning.

# An Effective Trajectory Planning and an Optimized Path Planning for a 6-Degree-of-Freedom Robot Manipulator 

**Title (ZH)**: 一种有效的六自由度机器人 manipulator 轨迹规划及优化路径规划 

**Authors**: Takumu Okazaki, Akira Terui, Masahiko Mikawa  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00828)  

**Abstract**: An effective method for optimizing path planning for a specific model of a 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator is presented as part of the motion planning of the manipulator using computer algebra. We assume that we are given a path in the form of a set of line segments that the end-effector should follow. We also assume that we have a method to solve the inverse kinematic problem of the manipulator at each via-point of the trajectory. The proposed method consists of three steps. First, we calculate the feasible region of the manipulator under a specific configuration of the end-effector. Next, we aim to find a trajectory on the line segments and a sequence of joint configurations the manipulator should follow to move the end-effector along the specified trajectory. Finally, we find the optimal combination of solutions to the inverse kinematic problem at each via-point along the trajectory by reducing the problem to a shortest-path problem of the graph and applying Dijkstra's algorithm. We show the effectiveness of the proposed method by experiments.

# Inverse Kinematics for a 6-Degree-of-Freedom Robot Manipulator Using Comprehensive Gröbner Systems 

**Title (ZH)**: 使用综合格消系统求解六自由度机器人 manipulator 的逆向动力学 

**Authors**: Takumu Okazaki, Akira Terui, Masahiko Mikawa  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00823)  

**Abstract**: We propose an effective method for solving the inverse kinematic problem of a specific model of 6-degree-of-freedom (6-DOF) robot manipulator using computer algebra. It is known that when the rotation axes of three consecutive rotational joints of a manipulator intersect at a single point, the inverse kinematics problem can be divided into determining position and orientation. We extend this method to more general manipulators in which the rotational axes of two consecutive joints intersect. This extension broadens the class of 6-DOF manipulators for which the inverse kinematics problem can be solved, and is expected to enable more efficient solutions. The inverse kinematic problem is solved using the Comprehensive Gröbner System (CGS) with joint parameters of the robot appearing as parameters in the coefficients to prevent repetitive calculations of the Gröbner bases. The effectiveness of the proposed method is shown by experiments. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 我们提出了一种有效的方法，使用计算机代数解决特定6自由度（6-DOF）机器人 manipulator 的逆运动学问题。当 manipulator 连续三个旋转关节的旋转轴在单一点相交时，逆运动学问题可以分解为确定位置和姿态。我们将此方法扩展到连续两个关节的旋转轴相交的更通用的 manipulator。这种扩展扩大了可以使用逆运动学问题解决方案的6-DOF manipulator 类别，并有望实现更高效的解决方案。通过使用综合格罗布ner系统（CGS）并使机器人关节参数出现在系数中作为参数，以防止格罗布ner基的重复计算，逆运动学问题得到解决。所提出方法的有效性通过实验得到了证实。

# A Risk-aware Spatial-temporal Trajectory Planning Framework for Autonomous Vehicles Using QP-MPC and Dynamic Hazard Fields 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于QP-MPC和动态危险场的自驾车风险意识时空轨迹规划框架 

**Authors**: Zhen Tian, Zhihao Lin, Dezong Zhao, Christos Anagnostopoulos, Qiyuan Wang, Wenjing Zhao, Xiaodan Wang, Chongfeng Wei  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00643)  

**Abstract**: Trajectory planning is a critical component in ensuring the safety, stability, and efficiency of autonomous vehicles. While existing trajectory planning methods have achieved progress, they often suffer from high computational costs, unstable performance in dynamic environments, and limited validation across diverse scenarios. To overcome these challenges, we propose an enhanced QP-MPC-based framework that incorporates three key innovations: (i) a novel cost function designed with a dynamic hazard field, which explicitly balances safety, efficiency, and comfort; (ii) seamless integration of this cost function into the QP-MPC formulation, enabling direct optimization of desired driving behaviors; and (iii) extensive validation of the proposed framework across complex tasks. The spatial safe planning is guided by a dynamic hazard field (DHF) for risk assessment, while temporal safe planning is based on a space-time graph. Besides, the quintic polynomial sampling and sub-reward of comforts are used to ensure comforts during lane-changing. The sub-reward of efficiency is used to maintain driving efficiency. Finally, the proposed DHF-enhanced objective function integrates multiple objectives, providing a proper optimization tasks for QP-MPC. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework outperforms benchmark optimization methods in terms of efficiency, stability, and comfort across a variety of scenarios likes lane-changing, overtaking, and crossing intersections.

# Safe and Efficient Lane-Changing for Autonomous Vehicles: An Improved Double Quintic Polynomial Approach with Time-to-Collision Evaluation 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于时间碰撞评估的改进双 quintic 多项式方法：自主车辆安全高效变道研究 

**Authors**: Rui Bai, Rui Xu, Teng Rui, Jiale Liu, Qi Wei Oung, Hoi Leong Lee, Zhen Tian, Fujiang Yuan

**Abstract**: Autonomous driving technology has made significant advancements in recent years, yet challenges remain in ensuring safe and comfortable interactions with human-driven vehicles (HDVs), particularly during lane-changing maneuvers. This paper proposes an improved double quintic polynomial approach for safe and efficient lane-changing in mixed traffic environments. The proposed method integrates a time-to-collision (TTC) based evaluation mechanism directly into the trajectory optimization process, ensuring that the ego vehicle proactively maintains a safe gap from surrounding HDVs throughout the maneuver. The framework comprises state estimation for both the autonomous vehicle (AV) and HDVs, trajectory generation using double quintic polynomials, real-time TTC computation, and adaptive trajectory evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to embed an analytic TTC penalty directly into the closed-form double-quintic polynomial solver, enabling real-time safety-aware trajectory generation without post-hoc validation. Extensive simulations conducted under diverse traffic scenarios demonstrate the safety, efficiency, and comfort of the proposed approach compared to conventional methods such as quintic polynomials, Bezier curves, and B-splines. The results highlight that the improved method not only avoids collisions but also ensures smooth transitions and adaptive decision-making in dynamic environments. This work bridges the gap between model-based and adaptive trajectory planning approaches, offering a stable solution for real-world autonomous driving applications. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 自主驾驶技术在近年来取得了显著进展，但仍面临与人工驾驶车辆（HDVs）在变道时确保安全舒适交互的挑战。本文提出了一种改进的双五次多项式方法，以实现混合交通环境中安全和高效的变道。该方法将基于碰撞时间（TTC）的评估机制直接融入轨迹优化过程，确保自主车辆在整个变道过程中主动与周围HDVs保持安全距离。该框架包括自主车辆（AV）和HDVs的状态估计、使用双五次多项式生成轨迹、实时计算TTC以及适应性轨迹评估。据我们所知，这是首次将解析TTC惩罚直接嵌入闭式双五次多项式求解器中，从而实现无需事后验证的实时安全意识轨迹生成。在多种交通场景下进行的广泛仿真表明，与传统的五次多项式、贝兹曲线和B样条等方法相比，所提出的方法在安全性、效率和舒适性方面具有显著优势。这些结果表明，改进的方法不仅避免了碰撞，还确保了在动态环境中平滑过渡和适应性决策。本文填补了基于模型和自适应轨迹规划方法之间的空白，提供了一种适用于实际自主驾驶应用的稳定解决方案。

# Gray-Box Computed Torque Control for Differential-Drive Mobile Robot Tracking 

**Title (ZH)**: 灰盒差动驱动移动机器人轨迹跟踪计算扭矩控制 

**Authors**: Arman Javan Sekhavat Pishkhani  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00571)  

**Abstract**: This study presents a learning-based nonlinear algorithm for tracking control of differential-drive mobile robots. The Computed Torque Method (CTM) suffers from inaccurate knowledge of system parameters, while Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithms are known for sample inefficiency and weak stability guarantees. The proposed method replaces the black-box policy network of a DRL agent with a gray-box Computed Torque Controller (CTC) to improve sample efficiency and ensure closed-loop stability. This approach enables finding an optimal set of controller parameters for an arbitrary reward function using only a few short learning episodes. The Twin-Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) algorithm is used for this purpose. Additionally, some controller parameters are constrained to lie within known value ranges, ensuring the RL agent learns physically plausible values. A technique is also applied to enforce a critically damped closed-loop time response. The controller's performance is evaluated on a differential-drive mobile robot simulated in the MuJoCo physics engine and compared against the raw CTC and a conventional kinematic controller.

**Abstract**: Tissue biopsy is the gold standard for diagnosing many diseases, involving the extraction of diseased tissue for histopathology analysis by expert pathologists. However, this procedure has two main limitations: 1) Manual sampling through tissue biopsy is prone to inaccuracies; 2) The extraction process is followed by a time-consuming pathology test. To address these limitations, we present a compact, accurate, and maneuverable robotic insertion platform to overcome the limitations in traditional histopathology. Our platform is capable of steering a variety of tools with different sizes, including needle for tissue extraction and optical fibers for vibrational spectroscopy applications. This system facilitates the guidance of end-effector to the tissue and assists surgeons in navigating to the biopsy target area for multi-modal diagnosis. In this paper, we outline the general concept of our device, followed by a detailed description of its mechanical design and control scheme. We conclude with the validation of the system through a series of tests, including positioning accuracy, admittance performance, and tool insertion efficacy.

# NeuralSVCD for Efficient Swept Volume Collision Detection 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于神经网络的高效扫掠体积碰撞检测 NeuralSVCD 

**Authors**: Dongwon Son, Hojin Jung, Beomjoon Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00499)  

**Abstract**: Robot manipulation in unstructured environments requires efficient and reliable Swept Volume Collision Detection (SVCD) for safe motion planning. Traditional discrete methods potentially miss collisions between these points, whereas SVCD continuously checks for collisions along the entire trajectory. Existing SVCD methods typically face a trade-off between efficiency and accuracy, limiting practical use. In this paper, we introduce NeuralSVCD, a novel neural encoder-decoder architecture tailored to overcome this trade-off. Our approach leverages shape locality and temporal locality through distributed geometric representations and temporal optimization. This enhances computational efficiency without sacrificing accuracy. Comprehensive experiments show that NeuralSVCD consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art SVCD methods in terms of both collision detection accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrating its robust applicability across diverse robotic manipulation scenarios.

**Title (ZH)**: 扩展 diffeomorphism 在不同空间排列工作空间中的实时运动复制 

**Authors**: Masaki Saito, Shunki Itadera, Toshiyuki Murakami  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00491)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents two types of extended diffeomorphism designs to compensate for spatial placement differences between robot workspaces. Teleoperation of multiple robots is attracting attention to expand the utilization of the robot embodiment. Real-time reproduction of robot motion would facilitate the efficient execution of similar tasks by multiple robots. A challenge in the motion reproduction is compensating for the spatial arrangement errors of target keypoints in robot workspaces. This paper proposes a methodology for smooth mappings that transform primary robot poses into follower robot poses based on the predefined key points in each workspace. Through a picking task experiment using a dual-arm UR5 robot, this study demonstrates that the proposed mapping generation method can balance lower mapping errors for precise operation and lower mapping gradients for smooth replicated movement.

# Hybrid Perception and Equivariant Diffusion for Robust Multi-Node Rebar Tying 

**Title (ZH)**: 混合感知与同构扩散在鲁棒多节点钢筋绑扎中的应用 

**Authors**: Zhitao Wang, Yirong Xiong, Roberto Horowitz, Yanke Wang, Yuxing Han  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00065)  

**Abstract**: Rebar tying is a repetitive but critical task in reinforced concrete construction, typically performed manually at considerable ergonomic risk. Recent advances in robotic manipulation hold the potential to automate the tying process, yet face challenges in accurately estimating tying poses in congested rebar nodes. In this paper, we introduce a hybrid perception and motion planning approach that integrates geometry-based perception with Equivariant Denoising Diffusion on SE(3) (Diffusion-EDFs) to enable robust multi-node rebar tying with minimal training data. Our perception module utilizes density-based clustering (DBSCAN), geometry-based node feature extraction, and principal component analysis (PCA) to segment rebar bars, identify rebar nodes, and estimate orientation vectors for sequential ranking, even in complex, unstructured environments. The motion planner, based on Diffusion-EDFs, is trained on as few as 5-10 demonstrations to generate sequential end-effector poses that optimize collision avoidance and tying efficiency. The proposed system is validated on various rebar meshes, including single-layer, multi-layer, and cluttered configurations, demonstrating high success rates in node detection and accurate sequential tying. Compared with conventional approaches that rely on large datasets or extensive manual parameter tuning, our method achieves robust, efficient, and adaptable multi-node tying while significantly reducing data requirements. This result underscores the potential of hybrid perception and diffusion-driven planning to enhance automation in on-site construction tasks, improving both safety and labor efficiency.

**Title (ZH)**: 开 Vinci: 开放词汇顺序钢筋绑扎系统 

**Authors**: Mingze Liu, Sai Fan, Haozhen Li, Haobo Liang, Yixing Yuan, Yanke Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00064)  

**Abstract**: Robotic practices on the construction site emerge as an attention-attracting manner owing to their capability of tackle complex challenges, especially in the rebar-involved scenarios. Most of existing products and research are mainly focused on flat rebar setting with model training demands. To fulfill this gap, we propose OpenTie, a 3D training-free rebar tying framework utilizing a RGB-to-point-cloud generation and an open-vocabulary detection. We implements the OpenTie via a robotic arm with a binocular camera and guarantees a high accuracy by applying the prompt-based object detection method on the image filtered by our propose post-processing procedure based a image to point cloud generation framework. The system is flexible for horizontal and vertical rebar tying tasks and the experiments on the real-world rebar setting verifies that the effectiveness of the system in practice.

# Correspondence-Free, Function-Based Sim-to-Real Learning for Deformable Surface Control 

**Title (ZH)**: 无需对应关系的功能导向从仿真到现实的学习：可变形表面控制 

**Authors**: Yingjun Tian, Guoxin Fang, Renbo Su, Aoran Lyu, Neelotpal Dutta, Simeon Gill, Andrew Weightman, Charlie C.L. Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00060)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a correspondence-free, function-based sim-to-real learning method for controlling deformable freeform surfaces. Unlike traditional sim-to-real transfer methods that strongly rely on marker points with full correspondences, our approach simultaneously learns a deformation function space and a confidence map -- both parameterized by a neural network -- to map simulated shapes to their real-world counterparts. As a result, the sim-to-real learning can be conducted by input from either a 3D scanner as point clouds (without correspondences) or a motion capture system as marker points (tolerating missed markers). The resultant sim-to-real transfer can be seamlessly integrated into a neural network-based computational pipeline for inverse kinematics and shape control. We demonstrate the versatility and adaptability of our method on both vision devices and across four pneumatically actuated soft robots: a deformable membrane, a robotic mannequin, and two soft manipulators.

**Title (ZH)**: U2UData-2：一种适用于长周期任务的可扩展蜂群无人机自主飞行数据集 

**Authors**: Tongtong Feng, Xin Wang, Feilin Han, Leping Zhang, Wenwu Zhu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00055)  

**Abstract**: Swarm UAV autonomous flight for Long-Horizon (LH) tasks is crucial for advancing the low-altitude economy. However, existing methods focus only on specific basic tasks due to dataset limitations, failing in real-world deployment for LH tasks. LH tasks are not mere concatenations of basic tasks, requiring handling long-term dependencies, maintaining persistent states, and adapting to dynamic goal shifts. This paper presents U2UData-2, the first large-scale swarm UAV autonomous flight dataset for LH tasks and the first scalable swarm UAV data online collection and algorithm closed-loop verification platform. The dataset is captured by 15 UAVs in autonomous collaborative flights for LH tasks, comprising 12 scenes, 720 traces, 120 hours, 600 seconds per trajectory, 4.32M LiDAR frames, and 12.96M RGB frames. This dataset also includes brightness, temperature, humidity, smoke, and airflow values covering all flight routes. The platform supports the customization of simulators, UAVs, sensors, flight algorithms, formation modes, and LH tasks. Through a visual control window, this platform allows users to collect customized datasets through one-click deployment online and to verify algorithms by closed-loop simulation. U2UData-2 also introduces an LH task for wildlife conservation and provides comprehensive benchmarks with 9 SOTA models. U2UData-2 can be found at this https URL.

# Robustness Enhancement for Multi-Quadrotor Centralized Transportation System via Online Tuning and Learning 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于在线调优与学习的多无人机集中式运输系统鲁棒性增强 

**Authors**: Tianhua Gao, Kohji Tomita, Akiya Kamimura  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01952)  

**Abstract**: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro geometric control for a centralized multi-quadrotor cooperative transportation system, which enhances both adaptivity and disturbance rejection. Our strategy is to coactively tune the model parameters and learn the external disturbances in real-time. To realize this, we augmented the existing geometric control with multiple neural networks and adaptive laws, where the estimated model parameters and the weights of the neural networks are simultaneously tuned and adjusted online. The Lyapunov-based adaptation guarantees bounded estimation errors without requiring either pre-training or the persistent excitation (PE) condition. The proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov under certain preconditions, and its enhanced robustness under scenarios of disturbed environment and model-unmatched plant was demonstrated by numerical simulations.

# Online Identification using Adaptive Laws and Neural Networks for Multi-Quadrotor Centralized Transportation System 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于自适应律和神经网络的多旋翼集中运输系统在线辨识 

**Authors**: Tianhua Gao, Kohji Tomita, Akiya Kamimura  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01951)  

**Abstract**: This paper introduces an adaptive-neuro identification method that enhances the robustness of a centralized multi-quadrotor transportation system. This method leverages online tuning and learning on decomposed error subspaces, enabling efficient real-time compensation to time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties acting on the payload. The strategy is to decompose the high-dimensional error space into a set of low-dimensional subspaces. In this way, the identification problem for unseen features is naturally transformed into submappings (``slices'') addressed by multiple adaptive laws and shallow neural networks, which are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without requiring persistent excitation (PE) and offline training. Due to the model-free nature of neural networks, this approach can be well adapted to highly coupled and nonlinear centralized transportation systems. It serves as a feedforward compensator for the payload controller without explicitly relying on the dynamics coupled with the payload, such as cables and quadrotors. The proposed control system has been proven to be stable in the sense of Lyapunov, and its enhanced robustness under time-varying disturbances and model uncertainties was demonstrated by numerical simulations.

# Nonlinear Model Predictive Control-Based Reverse Path-Planning and Path-Tracking Control of a Vehicle with Trailer System 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于非线性模型预测控制的带挂车车辆反向路径规划与路径跟踪控制 

**Authors**: Xincheng Cao, Haochong Chen, Bilin Aksun-Guvenc, Levent Guvenc, Brian Link, Peter J Richmond, Dokyung Yim, Shihong Fan, John Harber  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.01820)  

**Abstract**: Reverse parking maneuvers of a vehicle with trailer system is a challenging task to complete for human drivers due to the unstable nature of the system and unintuitive controls required to orientate the trailer properly. This paper hence proposes an optimization-based automation routine to handle the path-planning and path-tracking control process of such type of maneuvers. The proposed approach utilizes nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) to robustly guide the vehicle-trailer system into the desired parking space, and an optional forward repositioning maneuver can be added as an additional stage of the parking process to obtain better system configurations, before backward motion can be attempted again to get a good final pose. The novelty of the proposed approach is the simplicity of its formulation, as the path-planning and path-tracking operations are only conducted on the trailer being viewed as a standalone vehicle, before the control inputs are propagated to the tractor vehicle via inverse kinematic relationships also derived in this paper. Simulation case studies and hardware-in-the-loop tests are performed, and the results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

**Title (ZH)**: 低成本3D打印伺服陀螺仪设计与 Thrust Vector Control 在模型火箭中的测试 

**Authors**: Ekansh Singh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00061)  

**Abstract**: Thrust vector control (TVC) is a key mechanism for stabilizing rockets during flight, yet conventional implementations remain costly and technically inaccessible to students and hobbyists. This paper presents the design, fabrication, and testing of a low-cost, 3D-printed, servo-driven two-dimensional gimbal developed for model rocket applications. The gimbal underwent more than 60 CAD iterations, with servo selection guided by torque, response time, and stability requirements. A high-speed camera and Fusion 360 parameter simulations were used to emulate dynamic instability, enabling evaluation of angular deflection, servo responsiveness, and structural durability. The results demonstrated stable actuation within plus or minus 5 degrees, with response times on the average order of 44.5 ms, while limitations included servo fatigue and pin-joint stress under extended loading. The project highlights the feasibility of student-accessible thrust vector control systems and their potential as a reproducible platform for STEM education and experimental aerospace research.

# A Framework for Task and Motion Planning based on Expanding AND/OR Graphs 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于扩展AND/OR图的任务与运动规划框架 

**Authors**: Fulvio Mastrogiovanni, Antony Thomas  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.00317)  

**Abstract**: Robot autonomy in space environments presents unique challenges, including high perception and motion uncertainty, strict kinematic constraints, and limited opportunities for human intervention. Therefore, Task and Motion Planning (TMP) may be critical for autonomous servicing, surface operations, or even in-orbit missions, just to name a few, as it models tasks as discrete action sequencing integrated with continuous motion feasibility assessments. In this paper, we introduce a TMP framework based on expanding AND/OR graphs, referred to as TMP-EAOG, and demonstrate its adaptability to different scenarios. TMP-EAOG encodes task-level abstractions within an AND/OR graph, which expands iteratively as the plan is executed, and performs in-the-loop motion planning assessments to ascertain their feasibility. As a consequence, TMP-EAOG is characterised by the desirable properties of (i) robustness to a certain degree of uncertainty, because AND/OR graph expansion can accommodate for unpredictable information about the robot environment, (ii) controlled autonomy, since an AND/OR graph can be validated by human experts, and (iii) bounded flexibility, in that unexpected events, including the assessment of unfeasible motions, can lead to different courses of action as alternative paths in the AND/OR graph. We evaluate TMP-EAOG on two benchmark domains. We use a simulated mobile manipulator as a proxy for space-grade autonomous robots. Our evaluation shows that TMP-EAOG can deal with a wide range of challenges in the benchmarks. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 空间环境中的机器人自主性面临独特的挑战，包括高感知和运动不确定性、严格的运动约束以及有限的人类干预机会。因此，任务与运动规划（TMP）可能是自主服务、表面操作或在轨任务等应用的关键，它将任务建模为离散动作序列与连续运动可行性评估的集成。本文介绍了一种基于扩展AND/OR图的TMP框架，称为TMP-EAOG，并展示了其在不同场景中的适应性。TMP-EAOG在执行计划的过程中迭代扩展AND/OR图，并进行在环运动规划评估以确定其可行性。因此，TMP-EAOG具备以下优点：（i）一定程度不确定性下的鲁棒性，因为AND/OR图扩展可以容纳不可预测的机器人环境信息；（ii）可控的自主性，因为AND/OR图可以由人类专家验证；（iii）有限的灵活性，意外事件，包括不可行性运动的评估，可能导致在AND/OR图中选择不同的行动路径。我们使用模拟移动 manipulator 作为空间级自主机器人代理，并在两个基准领域评估了TMP-EAOG。评估结果显示，TMP-EAOG能够应对基准中的广泛挑战。
