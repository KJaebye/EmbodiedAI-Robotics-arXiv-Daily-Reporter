Teleoperated robotic echocardiography has been proposed as a solution; however, clinical studies report longer examination times than manual procedures, increasing diagnostic delays and operator workload. Automating non-expert tasks, such as automatically moving the probe to an ideal starting pose, offers a pathway to reduce this burden. Prior vision- and depth-based approaches to estimate an initial probe pose are sensitive to lighting, texture, and anatomical variability. We propose a robot-mounted 2D LiDAR-based approach that reconstructs the chest surface in 3D and estimates the initial probe pose automatically. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of robot-mounted 2D LiDAR used for 3D reconstruction of a human body surface. Through plane-based extrinsic calibration, the transformation between the LiDAR and robot base frames was estimated with an overall root mean square (RMS) residual of 1.8 mm and rotational uncertainty below 0.2°. The chest front surface, reconstructed from two linear LiDAR sweeps, was aligned with non-rigid templates to identify an initial probe pose. A mannequin-based study assessing reconstruction accuracy showed mean surface errors of 2.78 +/- 0.21 mm.

While generative data augmentation is a common approach to introduce diversity, it presents a subtle challenge: data composition. Naively mixing real and synthetic data can corrupt the learning signal, as this process often prioritizes visual diversity at the expense of information fidelity. This paper suggests that robust generalization depends on principled, fidelity-aware data composition. We introduce Coherent Information Fidelity Tuning (CIFT), a framework that treats data composition as an optimization problem. CIFT uses a practical proxy for Information Fidelity based on the feature-space geometry of a dataset. This enables the identification of a phase transition, termed the Decoherence Point, where training stability degrades. The framework includes a generative engine, Multi-View Video Augmentation (MVAug), to synthesize a causally disentangled data spectrum for this tuning process.

Estimating disturbances across diverse environmental contexts is challenging due to the inherent variability and uncertainty in the real world. Such estimators require extensive fine-tuning for a specific scenario, which makes them inflexible and brittle to changing conditions. Machine-learning approaches, such as training a neural network to tune the estimator\'s parameters, are promising. However, collecting data across all possible environmental contexts is impossible. It is also inefficient as the same estimator parameters could work for "nearby" contexts. In this paper, we present a sequential decision making strategy that decides which environmental contexts, using Bayesian Optimization with a Gaussian Process, to collect data from in order to ensure robust performance across a wide range of contexts. Our method, Contextual NeuroMHE, eliminates the need for exhaustive training across all environments while maintaining robust performance under different conditions.

The goal is to construct the shortest path connecting given initial and final configurations subject to motion constraints. Our work differs from existing literature in two ways. First, we consider full vehicle orientation using a body-attached frame, which includes roll, pitch, and yaw angles. However, existing work uses only pitch and/or heading angle, which is insufficient to uniquely determine orientation. Second, we use two control inputs to represent bounded pitch and yaw rates, reflecting control by two separate actuators. In contrast, most previous methods rely on a single input, such as path curvature, which is insufficient for accurately modeling the vehicle's kinematics in 3D. We use a rotation minimizing frame to describe the vehicle's configuration and its evolution, and construct paths by concatenating optimal Dubins paths on spherical, cylindrical, or planar surfaces.

The practical quality of these solutions, however, critically depends on achieving rank-1 matrices, a condition that typically requires additional tightening.

These additional constraints not only capture important structural properties but also facilitate first-order methods for recovering rank-1 solutions. We introduce customized fixed-trace variables and constraints to represent common robotic quantities such as rotations and translations, which can be exactly recovered when the corresponding variables are rank-1. To further improve practical performance, we develop a gradient-based refinement procedure that projects relaxed SDP solutions toward rank-1, low-cost candidates, which can then be certified for global optimality via the dual problem. We demonstrate that many robotics tasks can be expressed within this trace-constrained SDP framework, and showcase its effectiveness through simulations in perspective-n-point (PnP) estimation, hand-eye calibration, and dual-robot system calibration.

As the field moves toward feedback control for practical applications, it becomes increasingly important to define what safety means and to characterize how soft robots can become unsafe. The unifying theme of soft robotics is to achieve useful functionality through deformation. Consequently, limitations in constitutive model accuracy and risks of material failure are inherent to all soft robots and pose a key challenge in designing provably safe controllers. This work introduces a formal definition of material safety based on strain energy functions and provides a controller that enforces it. We characterize safe and unsafe sets of an incompressible hyperelastic material and demonstrate that safety can be enforced using a high-order control barrier function (HOCBF) with quadratic program-based feedback control.

One of the most important tasks of these vehicles during autonomous operations is path planning. In the literature, path planners are generally divided into two categories: probabilistic and deterministic methods. In the analysis of probabilistic methods, the common problem of almost all methods is observed in narrow passage environments. In this paper, a novel sampler is proposed that deterministically identifies narrow passage environments using occupancy grid maps and accordingly increases the amount of sampling in these regions. The codes of the algorithm is provided as open source. To evaluate the performance of the algorithm, benchmark studies are conducted in three distinct categories: specific and random simulation environments, and a real-world environment.

To achieve this goal, ergodic coverage can be used to assign the number of samples according to the quality of observation, i.e., sampling noise levels. However, the noise levels are unknown to the robots. Although this noise can be estimated from samples, the estimates are unreliable at first and can generate fluctuating values. The main contribution of this paper is to use simulated annealing to generate the target sampling distribution, starting from uniform and gradually shifting to an estimated optimal distribution, by varying the coldness parameter of a Boltzmann distribution with the estimated sampling entropy as energy. Simulation results show a substantial improvement of both transient and asymptotic entropy compared to both uniform and direct-ergodic searches.

Specifically, coarse localization by deep neural network (DNN)-based Wi-Fi RSSI fingerprinting is refined by IMU-based dynamic positioning using a Gmapping-based SLAM to generate an occupancy grid map and output high-frequency attitude estimates, which is followed by EKF prediction-update integrating sensor information while effectively suppressing Wi-Fi-induced noise and IMU drift errors. Multi-group real-world experiments conducted on the IR building at Xi'an Jiaotong-Liverpool University demonstrates that the proposed multi-sensor fusion framework suppresses the instability caused by individual approaches and thereby provides stable accuracy across all path configurations with mean two-dimensional (2D) errors ranging from 0.2449 m to 0.3781 m.

Common methods, such as approximate convex decomposition, represent a mesh as a collection of simple parts, which are computationally inexpensive to simulate. However, existing approaches apply a uniform error tolerance across the entire mesh, which can result in a sub-optimal trade-off between accuracy and performance. For instance, a robot grasping an object needs high-fidelity geometry in the vicinity of the contact surfaces but can tolerate a coarser simplification elsewhere. A uniform tolerance can lead to excessive detail in non-critical areas or insufficient detail where it's needed most.\nTo address this limitation, we introduce Empart, an interactive tool that allows users to specify different simplification tolerances for selected regions of a mesh. Our method leverages existing convex decomposition algorithms as a sub-routine but uses a novel, parallelized framework to handle region-specific constraints efficiently. Empart provides a user-friendly interface with visual feedback on approximation error and simulation performance, enabling designers to iteratively refine their decomposition. We demonstrate that our approach significantly reduces the number of convex parts compared to a state-of-the-art method (V-HACD) at a fixed error threshold, leading to substantial speedups in simulation performance.

Classical planners often generate inefficient, high-cost plans by shuffling objects individually and using fixed buffers--temporary spaces such as empty table regions or static stacks--to resolve conflicts. When only free table locations are used as buffers, dense scenes become inefficient, since placing an object can restrict others from reaching their goals and complicate planning. Allowing stacking provides extra buffer capacity, but conventional stacking is static: once an object supports another, the base cannot be moved, which limits efficiency. To overcome these issues, a novel planning primitive called the Dynamic Buffer is introduced. Inspired by human grouping strategies, it enables robots to form temporary, movable stacks that can be transported as a unit. This improves both feasibility and efficiency in dense layouts, and it also reduces travel in large-scale settings where space is abundant. Compared with a state-of-the-art rearrangement planner, the approach reduces manipulator travel cost by 11.89% in dense scenarios with a stationary robot and by 5.69% in large, low-density settings with a mobile manipulator. Practicality is validated through experiments on a Delta parallel robot with a two-finger gripper.

SafeFlowMatcher uses a two-phase prediction-correction (PC) integrator: (i) a prediction phase integrates the learned FM once (or a few steps) to obtain a candidate path without intervention; (ii) a correction phase refines this path with a vanishing time-scaled vector field and a CBF-based quadratic program that minimally perturbs the vector field.
