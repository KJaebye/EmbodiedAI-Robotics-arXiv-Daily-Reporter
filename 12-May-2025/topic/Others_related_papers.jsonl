Custom tools were developed to mark the intersections, synchronize location and video data, and clip the cabin and scene videos for +/-100 meters from the intersection location.

To specify such dependencies, feature models are commonly used. As feature models in practice are often complex, automated reasoning is typically employed to analyze the dependencies. Here, the de facto standard is translating the feature model to conjunctive normal form (CNF) to enable employing off-the-shelf tools, such as SAT or #SAT solvers. However, modern feature-modeling dialects often contain constructs, such as cardinality constraints, that are ill-suited for conversion to CNF. This mismatch between the input of reasoning engines and the available feature-modeling dialects limits the applicability of the more expressive constructs. In this work, we shorten this gap between expressive constructs and scalable automated reasoning. Our contribution is twofold: First, we provide a pseudo-Boolean encoding for feature models, which facilitates smaller representations of commonly employed constructs compared to Boolean encoding. Second, we propose a novel method to compile pseudo-Boolean formulas to Boolean d-DNNF. With the compiled d-DNNFs, we can resort to a plethora of efficient analyses already used in feature modeling. Our empirical evaluation shows that our proposal substantially outperforms the state-of-the-art based on CNF inputs for expressive constructs. For every considered dataset representing different feature models and feature-modeling constructs, the feature models can be significantly faster translated to pseudo-Boolean than to CNF. Overall, deriving d-DNNFs from a feature model with the targeted expressive constraints can be substantially accelerated using our pseudo-Boolean approach. Furthermore, our approach is competitive on feature models with only basic constructs.', 'abstract_zh': '可配置系统通常由具有彼此依赖关系的可重用资产组成。为了指定这些依赖关系，通常使用特征模型。由于特征模型在实践中往往非常复杂，因此通常会使用自动推理来分析这些依赖关系。目前的标准做法是将特征模型转换为合取范式（CNF），以便使用现成的工具，如SAT或#SAT求解器。然而，现代特征建模方言中包含的一些构造，如基数约束，不适合转换为CNF。这种推理引擎输入与可用的特征建模方言之间的不匹配限制了更富有表现力的构造的应用。本文在富有表现力的构造与可扩展自动推理之间缩短了这一差距。我们的贡献有两个方面：首先，我们提供了一种伪布尔编码方法，相对于布尔编码，这种方法对于常用构造提供了更小的表示形式。其次，我们提出了一种将伪布尔公式编译为布尔d-DNNF的新方法。使用编译后的d-DNNF，我们可以利用已经在特征建模中广泛使用的各种高效分析方法。我们的实证评估表明，与基于CNF输入的现有方法相比，我们的提议在处理富有表现力的构造时显著表现出色。对于每一种代表不同特征模型和特征建模构造的数据集，特征模型可以显著更快地转化为伪布尔表达式，而非CNF。总体而言，使用我们的伪布尔方法从特征模型导出带目标富有表现力约束的d-DNNF可以显著加速计算。此外，对于仅包含基本构造的特征模型，我们的方法具有竞争力。', 'title_zh': '伪布尔d-DNNF编译在表达性特征建模构造中的应用'}

In scenarios where there is a gap between trace events and reference business activities, this entails an interpretation problem, amounting to translating each event of any ongoing trace into the corresponding step of the activity instance. Building on a recent approach that frames the interpretation problem as an acceptance problem within an Abstract Argumentation Framework (AAF), one can elegantly analyze plausible event interpretations (possibly in an aggregated form), as well as offer explanations for those that conflict with prior process knowledge. Since, in settings where event-to-activity mapping is highly uncertain (or simply under-specified) this reasoning-based approach may yield lowly-informative results and heavy computation, one can think of discovering a sequencetagging model, trained to suggest highly-probable candidate event interpretations in a context-aware way. However, training such a model optimally may require using a large amount of manually-annotated example traces. Considering the urgent need of developing Green AI solutions enabling environmental and societal sustainability (with reduced labor/computational costs and carbon footprint), we propose a data/computation-efficient neuro-symbolic approach to the problem, where the candidate interpretations returned by the example-driven sequence tagger is refined by the AAF-based reasoner.

A central element of our analysis is the propagation of regularity: while the transformation induced by a single Bellman operator application exhibits regularity, for which Backward Stochastic Differential Equations (BSDEs) theory provides analytical tools, the uniform regularity of the entire sequence of value iteration iterates--specifically, their uniform Lipschitz continuity on compact domains under standard Lipschitz assumptions on the problem data--is derived from finite-horizon dynamic programming principles. We demonstrate that layers of a deep residual network, conceived as neural operators acting on function spaces, can approximate the action of the Bellman operator.

The primary bottleneck that arises from the exponential growth in activation sizes is driven by the unique data structure in PPM, which introduces an additional dimension that leads to substantial memory and computational demands. These limitations have hindered the effective scaling of PPM for real-world applications, such as analyzing large proteins or complex multimers with critical biological and pharmaceutical relevance.\nIn this paper, we present LightNobel, the first hardware-software co-designed accelerator developed to overcome scalability limitations on the sequence length in PPM.

However, even state-of-the-art OCRs can introduce errors, especially in degraded or complex documents. Recent vision-language approaches, such as ColPali, propose direct visual embedding of documents, eliminating the need for OCR. This study presents a systematic comparison between a vision-based RAG system (ColPali) and more traditional OCR-based pipelines utilizing Llama 3.2 (90B) and Nougat OCR across varying document qualities. Beyond conventional retrieval accuracy metrics, we introduce a semantic answer evaluation benchmark to assess end-to-end question-answering performance. Our findings indicate that while vision-based RAG performs well on documents it has been fine-tuned on, OCR-based RAG is better able to generalize to unseen documents of varying quality.

With the increasing presence of artificial agents in daily life, it is essential to understand how people perceive and trust these agents. One of the key challenges affecting this perception is the Uncanny Valley Effect (UVE), where increasingly human-like artificial beings can be perceived as eerie or repelling. Despite growing interest in trust and the UVE, existing research varies widely in terms of how these concepts are defined and operationalized. This inconsistency raises important questions about how and under what conditions the UVE influences trust in agents. A systematic understanding of their relationship is currently lacking. This review aims to examine the impact of the UVE on human trust in agents and to identify methodological patterns, limitations, and gaps in the existing empirical literature. Following PRISMA guidelines, a systematic search identified 53 empirical studies that investigated both UVE-related constructs and trust or trust-related outcomes. Studies were analyzed based on a structured set of categories, including types of agents and interactions, methodological and measurement approaches, and key findings. The results of our systematic review reveal that most studies rely on static images or hypothetical scenarios with limited real-time interaction, and the majority use subjective trust measures. This review offers a novel framework for classifying trust measurement approaches with regard to the best-practice criteria for empirically investigating the UVE.

However, this approach faces fundamental challenges in graphs due to their discrete, non-Euclidean nature -- view generation often breaks semantic validity and similarity verification becomes unreliable. Through analyzing 11 real-world graphs, we discover a universal pattern transcending the homophily-heterophily dichotomy: label consistency systematically diminishes as structural distance increases, manifesting as smooth decay in homophily graphs and oscillatory decay in heterophily graphs. We establish theoretical guarantees for this pattern through random walk theory, proving label distribution convergence and characterizing the mechanisms behind different decay behaviors. This discovery reveals that graphs naturally encode relative similarity patterns, where structurally closer nodes exhibit collectively stronger semantic relationships. Leveraging this insight, we propose RELGCL, a novel GCL framework with complementary pairwise and listwise implementations that preserve these inherent patterns through collective similarity objectives.
