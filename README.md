### CV: Computer Vision
Studies including deep learning for object detection, image segmentation, image generation and editing, video generation and editing, video understanding, and 3D computer vision.

### EAI: Embodied AI
The research focuses on how agents generate intelligence through body-environment interaction, covering embodied cognition, environment simulation, autonomous robotics, end-to-end perception, multimodal learning, visual navigation, language-vision-action integration, large-scale robotics models, world models, and real-world video dynamics.

### LLM: NLP Models
Researches on foundational language models and general foundational models. Note: LLMs for robotics fall under EAI and not this category.

### MultiModal: Large Multimodal Models
Studies including multimodal models, such as text-image, text-text, text-video, and text-audio. Note: Multimodal models for robotics fall under EAI and not this category.

### RO: Robotics
The research focuses on robotic mechanical design, materials science, manufacturing, motion planning and control, system integration, and applications, emphasizing automation and sensors over intelligence. It includes tactile and force sensing, various controllers, novel mechanism design, modeling and control, UAV, UGV, USV control, and bionic robots.

### Others
Other studies.
