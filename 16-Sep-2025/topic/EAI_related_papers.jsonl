A primary bottleneck is the reliance on coordinate-dependent models, which leads to profound data inefficiency by failing to generalize physical interactions across different frames of reference. This forces learning algorithms to rediscover fundamental physical principles in every new orientation, artificially inflating the complexity of the learning task. This paper introduces a novel framework that synergizes a coordinate-free, unreduced multibody dynamics and kinematics model based on tensor mechanics with a Data-Assisted Control (DAC) architecture. A non-recursive, closed-form Newton-Euler model in an augmented matrix form is derived that is optimized for tensor-based control design. This structure enables a principled decomposition of the system into a structurally certain, physically grounded part and an uncertain, empirical, and interaction-focused part, mediated by a virtual port variable. Then, a complete, end-to-end tensor-invariant pipeline for modeling, control, and learning is proposed. The coordinate-free control laws for the structurally certain part provide a stable and abstract command interface, proven via Lyapunov analysis. Eventually, the model and closed-loop system are validated through simulations. This work provides a naturally ideal input for data-efficient, frame-invariant learning algorithms, such as equivariant learning, designed to learn the uncertain interaction.

Our method first trains a diffusion policy in SE(3) space using demonstrations from a base manipulator. During online deployment, it projects the policy's generated trajectories to satisfy the kinematic and task-specific constraints imposed by the new hardware and objectives.

In an offline stage, we render a dense set of views of the CAD model, compute the FoundationPose entropy for each view, and construct a geometric-aware prompt that includes low-entropy (unambiguous) and high-entropy (ambiguous) examples. At runtime, the system: (1) queries the VLM on the live image for an ambiguity score; (2) if ambiguity is detected, imagines a discrete set of candidate camera poses by rendering virtual views, scores each based on a weighted combination of VLM ambiguity probability and FoundationPose entropy, and then moves the camera to the Next-Best-View (NBV) to obtain a disambiguated pose estimation. Furthermore, since moving objects may leave the camera\'s field of view, we introduce an active pose tracking module: a diffusion-policy trained via imitation learning, which generates camera trajectories that preserve object visibility and minimize pose ambiguity.

In this work, we introduce MEMBOT, a modular memory-based architecture designed to address intermittent partial observability in robotic control tasks. MEMBOT decouples belief inference from policy learning through a two-phase training process: an offline multi-task learning pretraining stage that learns a robust task-agnostic latent belief encoder using a reconstruction losses, followed by fine-tuning of task-specific policies using behavior cloning. The belief encoder, implemented as a state-space model (SSM) and a LSTM, integrates temporal sequences of observations and actions to infer latent state representations that persist even when observations are dropped. We train and evaluate MEMBOT on 10 robotic manipulation benchmark tasks from MetaWorld and Robomimic under varying rates of observation dropout. Results show that MEMBOT consistently outperforms both memoryless and naively recur- rent baselines, maintaining up to 80% of peak performance under 50% observation availability.

However, existing zero-shot VLN methods depend on costly perception and passive scene understanding, collapsing control to point-level choices. As a result, they are expensive to deploy, misaligned in action semantics, and short-sighted in planning. To address these issues, we present DreamNav that focuses on the following three aspects: (1) for reducing sensory cost, our EgoView Corrector aligns viewpoints and stabilizes egocentric perception; (2) instead of point-level actions, our Trajectory Predictor favors global trajectory-level planning to better align with instruction semantics; and (3) to enable anticipatory and long-horizon planning, we propose an Imagination Predictor to endow the agent with proactive thinking capability.

While the paradigm of scaling models and datasets has led to remarkable emergent capabilities, we argue that scaling the structure, fidelity, and logical consistency of agent reasoning within these environments is a crucial, yet underexplored, dimension of AI research.

In this work, we use of immutable, domain-specific knowledge to make infere information, which is encoded as logical constraints essential for proper diagnosis. In the proposed model, we show constraints that actively guide the hypothesis generation of LMs, effectively preventing them from reaching physically or logically untenable conclusions.

First, we provide a novel modeling means for the AI-driven perception processes by looking at their error characteristics. Specifically, three fundamental AI-induced perception uncertainties are recognized and modeled by Markov chains, Gaussian processes, and bounded disturbances, respectively. By means of that, the closed-loop stochastic stability (SS) is established in the sense of mean square, and then, an SS control synthesis method is presented within the framework of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). Besides the SS properties, the robustness and performance of AI-based AVs are discussed in terms of a stochastic guaranteed cost, and criteria are given to test the robustness level of an AV when in the presence of AI-induced uncertainties. Furthermore, the stochastic optimal guaranteed cost control is investigated, and an efficient design procedure is developed innovatively based on LMI techniques and convex optimization.

We propose TabPFN RL, a novel gradient free deep RL framework that repurposes the meta trained transformer TabPFN as a Q function approximator. Originally developed for tabular classification, TabPFN is a transformer pre trained on millions of synthetic datasets to perform inference on new unseen datasets via in context learning. Given an in context dataset of sample label pairs and new unlabeled data, it predicts the most likely labels in a single forward pass, without gradient updates or task specific fine tuning. We use TabPFN to predict Q values using inference only, thereby eliminating the need for back propagation at both training and inference. To cope with the model's fixed context budget, we design a high reward episode gate that retains only the top 5% of trajectories. Empirical evaluations on the Gymnasium classic control suite demonstrate that TabPFN RL matches or surpasses Deep Q Network on CartPole v1, MountainCar v0, and Acrobot v1, without applying gradient descent or any extensive hyperparameter tuning. We discuss the theoretical aspects of how bootstrapped targets and non stationary visitation distributions violate the independence assumptions encoded in TabPFN's prior, yet the model retains a surprising generalization capacity.

Connected and automated factories face growing cybersecurity risks that can potentially cause interruptions and damages to physical operations. Among these attacks, data-integrity attacks often involve sophisticated exploitation of vulnerabilities that enable an attacker to access and manipulate the operational data and are hence difficult to detect with only existing intrusion detection or model-based detection. This paper addresses the challenges in utilizing existing side-channels to detect data-integrity attacks in robotic manufacturing processes by developing an online detection framework, ViSTR-GP, that cross-checks encoder-reported measurements against a vision-based estimate from an overhead camera outside the controller's authority. In this framework, a one-time interactive segmentation initializes SAM-Track to generate per-frame masks. A low-rank tensor-regression surrogate maps each mask to measurements, while a matrix-variate Gaussian process models nominal residuals, capturing temporal structure and cross-joint correlations. A frame-wise test statistic derived from the predictive distribution provides an online detector with interpretable thresholds. We validate the framework on a real-world robotic testbed with synchronized video frame and encoder data, collecting multiple nominal cycles and constructing replay attack scenarios with graded end-effector deviations. Results on the testbed indicate that the proposed framework recovers joint angles accurately and detects data-integrity attacks earlier with more frequent alarms than all baselines.
