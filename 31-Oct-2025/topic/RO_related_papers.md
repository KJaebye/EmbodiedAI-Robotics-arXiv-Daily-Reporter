**Abstract**: The European Space Agency (ESA) and the European Space Resources Innovation Centre (ESRIC) created the Space Resources Challenge to invite researchers and companies to propose innovative solutions for Multi-Robot Systems (MRS) space prospection. This paper proposes the Resilient Exploration And Lunar Mapping System 2 (REALMS2), a MRS framework for planetary prospection and mapping. Based on Robot Operating System version 2 (ROS 2) and enhanced with Visual Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping (vSLAM) for map generation, REALMS2 uses a mesh network for a robust ad hoc network. A single graphical user interface (GUI) controls all the rovers, providing a simple overview of the robotic mission. This system is designed for heterogeneous multi-robot exploratory missions, tackling the challenges presented by extraterrestrial environments. REALMS2 was used during the second field test of the ESA-ESRIC Challenge and allowed to map around 60% of the area, using three homogeneous rovers while handling communication delays and blackouts.

# FLYINGTRUST: A Benchmark for Quadrotor Navigation Across Scenarios and Vehicles 

**Title (ZH)**: FLYINGTRUST：多场景多无人机旋翼飞行器导航基准测试 

**Authors**: Gang Li, Chunlei Zhai, Teng Wang, Shaun Li, Shangsong Jiang, Xiangwei Zhu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26588)  

**Abstract**: Visual navigation algorithms for quadrotors often exhibit a large variation in performance when transferred across different vehicle platforms and scene geometries, which increases the cost and risk of field deployment. To support systematic early-stage evaluation, we introduce FLYINGTRUST, a high-fidelity, configurable benchmarking framework that measures how platform kinodynamics and scenario structure jointly affect navigation robustness. FLYINGTRUST models vehicle capability with two compact, physically interpretable indicators: maximum thrust-to-weight ratio and axis-wise maximum angular acceleration. The benchmark pairs a diverse scenario library with a heterogeneous set of real and virtual platforms and prescribes a standardized evaluation protocol together with a composite scoring method that balances scenario importance, platform importance and performance stability. We use FLYINGTRUST to compare representative optimization-based and learning-based navigation approaches under identical conditions, performing repeated trials per platform-scenario combination and reporting uncertainty-aware metrics. The results reveal systematic patterns: navigation success depends predictably on platform capability and scene geometry, and different algorithms exhibit distinct preferences and failure modes across the evaluated conditions. These observations highlight the practical necessity of incorporating both platform capability and scenario structure into algorithm design, evaluation, and selection, and they motivate future work on methods that remain robust across diverse platforms and scenarios.

# Adaptive Inverse Kinematics Framework for Learning Variable-Length Tool Manipulation in Robotics 

**Title (ZH)**: 适应性逆运动学框架：学习机器人中可变长度工具操作 

**Authors**: Prathamesh Kothavale, Sravani Boddepalli  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26551)  

**Abstract**: Conventional robots possess a limited understanding of their kinematics and are confined to preprogrammed tasks, hindering their ability to leverage tools efficiently. Driven by the essential components of tool usage - grasping the desired outcome, selecting the most suitable tool, determining optimal tool orientation, and executing precise manipulations - we introduce a pioneering framework. Our novel approach expands the capabilities of the robot's inverse kinematics solver, empowering it to acquire a sequential repertoire of actions using tools of varying lengths. By integrating a simulation-learned action trajectory with the tool, we showcase the practicality of transferring acquired skills from simulation to real-world scenarios through comprehensive experimentation. Remarkably, our extended inverse kinematics solver demonstrates an impressive error rate of less than 1 cm. Furthermore, our trained policy achieves a mean error of 8 cm in simulation. Noteworthy, our model achieves virtually indistinguishable performance when employing two distinct tools of different lengths. This research provides an indication of potential advances in the exploration of all four fundamental aspects of tool usage, enabling robots to master the intricate art of tool manipulation across diverse tasks. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 传统机器人对自身运动学的理解有限，只能执行预编程任务，限制了它们高效利用工具的能力。基于工具使用的核心组成部分——抓取所需的成果、选择最适合的工具、确定最佳工具姿态以及执行精确操作——我们提出了一种开创性框架。我们的新型方法扩展了机器人逆运动学解算器的功能，使其能够使用不同长度的工具获取一系列连续的操作。通过将模拟学习的动作轨迹与工具结合，我们展示了将从模拟中获得的技能转移到实际场景中的可行性，通过全面的实验进行了证明。值得注意的是，我们的扩展逆运动学解算器表现出小于1 cm的显著低误差率。此外，我们的训练策略在模拟中的平均误差为8 cm。特别地，当使用两种不同长度的工具时，我们的模型实现了几乎不可区分的性能。这项研究为探索工具使用的所有四个基本方面提供了可能的进步方向，使机器人能够掌握不同任务中复杂的工具操作艺术。

# Cooperative Task Spaces for Multi-Arm Manipulation Control based on Similarity Transformations 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于相似变换的多臂Manipulation控制合作任务空间 

**Authors**: Tobias Löw, Cem Bilaloglu, Sylvain Calinon  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26362)  

**Abstract**: Many tasks in human environments require collaborative behavior between multiple kinematic chains, either to provide additional support for carrying big and bulky objects or to enable the dexterity that is required for in-hand manipulation. Since these complex systems often have a very high number of degrees of freedom coordinating their movements is notoriously difficult to model. In this article, we present the derivation of the theoretical foundations for cooperative task spaces of multi-arm robotic systems based on geometric primitives defined using conformal geometric algebra. Based on the similarity transformations of these cooperative geometric primitives, we derive an abstraction of complex robotic systems that enables representing these systems in a way that directly corresponds to single-arm systems. By deriving the associated analytic and geometric Jacobian matrices, we then show the straightforward integration of our approach into classical control techniques rooted in operational space control. We demonstrate this using bimanual manipulators, humanoids and multi-fingered hands in optimal control experiments for reaching desired geometric primitives and in teleoperation experiments using differential kinematics control. We then discuss how the geometric primitives naturally embed nullspace structures into the controllers that can be exploited for introducing secondary control objectives. This work, represents the theoretical foundations of this cooperative manipulation control framework, and thus the experiments are presented in an abstract way, while giving pointers towards potential future applications.

# Adaptive Trajectory Refinement for Optimization-based Local Planning in Narrow Passages 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于优化的狭窄通道局部规划中的自适应轨迹精细调整 

**Authors**: Hahjin Lee, Young J. Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26142)  

**Abstract**: Trajectory planning for mobile robots in cluttered environments remains a major challenge due to narrow passages, where conventional methods often fail or generate suboptimal paths. To address this issue, we propose the adaptive trajectory refinement algorithm, which consists of two main stages. First, to ensure safety at the path-segment level, a segment-wise conservative collision test is applied, where risk-prone trajectory path segments are recursively subdivided until collision risks are eliminated. Second, to guarantee pose-level safety, pose correction based on penetration direction and line search is applied, ensuring that each pose in the trajectory is collision-free and maximally clear from obstacles. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 1.69x higher success rates and up to 3.79x faster planning times than state-of-the-art approaches. Furthermore, real-world experiments confirm that the robot can safely pass through narrow passages while maintaining rapid planning performance. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 移动机器人在拥挤环境中轨迹规划仍然是一个重大挑战，由于狭窄通道，传统方法往往失效或生成次优路径。为此，我们提出了一种自适应轨迹精炼算法，该算法包括两个主要阶段。首先，为了确保路径段级的安全性，应用逐段保守的碰撞检测，其中风险较高的轨迹路径段递归细分，直至消除碰撞风险。其次，为了保证构型级的安全性，基于穿透方向和线搜索进行构型校正，确保轨迹中的每个构型都是无碰撞且尽可能远离障碍物。仿真结果表明，所提出的方法在成功率达到最高1.69倍的同时，规划时间比最先进的方法快3.79倍。此外，实际实验验证了机器人可以在保持快速规划性能的同时安全通过狭窄通道。

# RADRON: Cooperative Localization of Ionizing Radiation Sources by MAVs with Compton Cameras 

**Title (ZH)**: RADRON：使用Compton相机的MAVs协作定位电离辐射源 

**Authors**: Petr Stibinger, Tomas Baca, Daniela Doubravova, Jan Rusnak, Jaroslav Solc, Jan Jakubek, Petr Stepan, Martin Saska  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26018)  

**Abstract**: We present a novel approach to localizing radioactive material by cooperating Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs). Our approach utilizes a state-of-the-art single-detector Compton camera as a highly sensitive, yet miniature detector of ionizing radiation. The detector's exceptionally low weight (40 g) opens up new possibilities of radiation detection by a team of cooperating agile MAVs. We propose a new fundamental concept of fusing the Compton camera measurements to estimate the position of the radiation source in real time even from extremely sparse measurements. The data readout and processing are performed directly onboard and the results are used in a dynamic feedback to drive the motion of the vehicles. The MAVs are stabilized in a tightly cooperating swarm to maximize the information gained by the Compton cameras, rapidly locate the radiation source, and even track a moving radiation source. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 我们提出了一种由微型飞行器协作实现放射性物质定位的新方法。该方法利用最先进的单探测器克勒普顿相机作为离子辐射的高灵敏度微型探测器。探测器的极低重量（40克）为合作灵活的微型飞行器团队提供了新的辐射探测可能性。我们提出了一种新的基本概念，即融合克勒普顿相机测量数据以实时从极少的测量数据中估计放射源的位置。数据读取和处理直接在飞行器上进行，并将结果用于动态反馈以驱动飞行器的运动。微型飞行器在紧密合作的集群中稳定，以最大化克勒普顿相机获得的信息，快速定位放射源，并能追踪移动的放射源。

# DARTS: A Drone-Based AI-Powered Real-Time Traffic Incident Detection System 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于无人机的AI驱动实时交通事件检测系统 

**Authors**: Bai Li, Achilleas Kourtellis, Rong Cao, Joseph Post, Brian Porter, Yu Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26004)  

**Abstract**: Rapid and reliable incident detection is critical for reducing crash-related fatalities, injuries, and congestion. However, conventional methods, such as closed-circuit television, dashcam footage, and sensor-based detection, separate detection from verification, suffer from limited flexibility, and require dense infrastructure or high penetration rates, restricting adaptability and scalability to shifting incident hotspots. To overcome these challenges, we developed DARTS, a drone-based, AI-powered real-time traffic incident detection system. DARTS integrates drones' high mobility and aerial perspective for adaptive surveillance, thermal imaging for better low-visibility performance and privacy protection, and a lightweight deep learning framework for real-time vehicle trajectory extraction and incident detection. The system achieved 99% detection accuracy on a self-collected dataset and supports simultaneous online visual verification, severity assessment, and incident-induced congestion propagation monitoring via a web-based interface. In a field test on Interstate 75 in Florida, DARTS detected and verified a rear-end collision 12 minutes earlier than the local transportation management center and monitored incident-induced congestion propagation, suggesting potential to support faster emergency response and enable proactive traffic control to reduce congestion and secondary crash risk. Crucially, DARTS's flexible deployment architecture reduces dependence on frequent physical patrols, indicating potential scalability and cost-effectiveness for use in remote areas and resource-constrained settings. This study presents a promising step toward a more flexible and integrated real-time traffic incident detection system, with significant implications for the operational efficiency and responsiveness of modern transportation management.

# A New Type of Axis-Angle Attitude Control Law for Rotational Systems: Synthesis, Analysis, and Experiments 

**Title (ZH)**: 一种新的轴角姿态控制律：综合、分析与实验 

**Authors**: Francisco M. F. R. Gonçalves, Ryan M. Bena, Néstor O. Pérez-Arancibia  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25985)  

**Abstract**: Over the past few decades, continuous quaternion-based attitude control has been proven highly effective for driving rotational systems that can be modeled as rigid bodies, such as satellites and drones. However, methods rooted in this approach do not enforce the existence of a unique closed-loop (CL) equilibrium attitude-error quaternion (AEQ); and, for rotational errors about the attitude-error Euler axis larger than {\pi}rad, their proportional-control effect diminishes as the system state moves away from the stable equilibrium of the CL rotational dynamics. In this paper, we introduce a new type of attitude control law that more effectively leverages the attitude-error Euler axis-angle information to guarantee a unique CL equilibrium AEQ and to provide greater flexibility in the use of proportional-control efforts. Furthermore, using two different control laws as examples-through the construction of a strict Lyapunov function for the CL dynamics-we demonstrate that the resulting unique equilibrium of the CL rotational system can be enforced to be uniformly asymptotically stable. To assess and demonstrate the functionality and performance of the proposed approach, we performed numerical simulations and executed dozens of real-time tumble-recovery maneuvers using a small quadrotor. These simulations and flight tests compellingly demonstrate that the proposed axis-angle-based method achieves superior flight performance-compared with that obtained using a high-performance quaternion-based controller-in terms of stabilization time. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 过去几十年中，基于四元数的连续姿态控制已被证明对可建模为刚体的旋转系统，如卫星和无人机，非常有效。然而，这类方法并未强制存在唯一的闭环（CL）姿态误差四元数（AEQ）均衡状态；并且当姿态误差沿姿态误差欧拉轴旋转的角度大于π弧度时，它们的比例控制效果会随着系统状态远离闭环旋转动力学的稳定均衡状态而减弱。本文提出了一种新的姿态控制律，更有效地利用了姿态误差欧拉轴-角信息，以保证唯一的闭环均衡姿态误差四元数，并提供了更大的比例控制努力的灵活性。此外，通过为闭环动力学构造严格李雅普unov函数，使用两种不同的控制律作为示例，证明了闭环旋转系统的唯一均衡可以被强制实现为一致渐近稳定。为了评估和展示所提出方法的功能和性能，我们进行了数值模拟，并使用小型四旋翼无人机执行了数十次翻滚复位机动。这些模拟和飞行测试有力地证明了基于轴-角的方法在稳定时间方面比高性能四元数控制方法实现了更优越的飞行性能。

# Curvature-Aware Calibration of Tactile Sensors for Accurate Force Estimation on Non-Planar Surfaces 

**Title (ZH)**: 曲率感知的触觉传感器标定以实现非-planar表面Force估计 

**Authors**: Luoyan Zhong, Heather Jin Hee Kim, Dylan P. Losey, Cara M. Nunez  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25965)  

**Abstract**: Flexible tactile sensors are increasingly used in real-world applications such as robotic grippers, prosthetic hands, wearable gloves, and assistive devices, where they need to conform to curved and irregular surfaces. However, most existing tactile sensors are calibrated only on flat substrates, and their accuracy and consistency degrade once mounted on curved geometries. This limitation restricts their reliability in practical use. To address this challenge, we develop a calibration model for a widely used resistive tactile sensor design that enables accurate force estimation on one-dimensional curved surfaces. We then train a neural network (a multilayer perceptron) to predict local curvature from baseline sensor outputs recorded under no applied load, achieving an R2 score of 0.91. The proposed approach is validated on five daily objects with varying curvatures under forces from 2 N to 8 N. Results show that the curvature-aware calibration maintains consistent force accuracy across all surfaces, while flat-surface calibration underestimates force as curvature increases. Our results demonstrate that curvature-aware modeling improves the accuracy, consistency, and reliability of flexible tactile sensors, enabling dependable performance across real-world applications. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 柔性触觉传感器在机器人夹爪、假手、可穿戴手套和辅助设备等需要适应曲面和不规则表面的实际应用中越来越受到重视。然而，大多数现有的触觉传感器仅在平坦基板上校准，一旦安装在曲面上，其准确度和一致性会下降。这种局限性限制了它们在实际应用中的可靠性。为解决这一挑战，我们开发了一种用于广泛使用的电阻式触觉传感器设计的校准模型，以在单一维度的曲面上实现准确的力估计。我们随后训练了一个神经网络（多层感知机）来预测在无负载条件下记录的基线传感器输出的局部曲率，实现了R2分数为0.91。提出的方法在不同曲率的五种日常物体上进行验证，力从2N到8N不等。结果显示，曲率感知校准能够在所有表面上保持一致的力精度，而平坦表面的校准随着曲率增加会低估力。我们的结果表明，曲率感知建模可以提高柔性触觉传感器的准确度、一致性和可靠性，使其在实际应用中表现出稳定性能。

**Title (ZH)**: 椭球型障碍物高效避撞约束在最优控制中的应用：以路径跟随预测控制和无人机为例 

**Authors**: David Leprich, Mario Rosenfelder, Markus Herrmann-Wicklmayr, Kathrin Flaßkamp, Peter Eberhard, Henrik Ebel  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26531)  

**Abstract**: This article proposes a modular optimal control framework for local three-dimensional ellipsoidal obstacle avoidance, exemplarily applied to model predictive path-following control. Static as well as moving obstacles are considered. Central to the approach is a computationally efficient and continuously differentiable condition for detecting collisions with ellipsoidal obstacles. A novel two-stage optimization approach mitigates numerical issues arising from the structure of the resulting optimal control problem. The effectiveness of the approach is demonstrated through simulations and real-world experiments with the Crazyflie quadrotor. This represents the first hardware demonstration of an MPC controller of this kind for UAVs in a three-dimensional task. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 本文提出了一种模块化的最优控制框架，用于局部三维椭球形障碍 avoidance，并以模型预测路径跟踪控制为例进行应用。该框架考虑了静态和移动障碍。该方法的核心是通过一种计算效率高且可连续求导的条件来检测与椭球形障碍的碰撞。采用一种新颖的两阶段优化方法来解决由此产生的最优控制问题所引发的数值问题。通过与Crazyflie四旋翼无人机的仿真实验和实地实验，验证了该方法的有效性。这标志着此类MPC控制器在三维任务中对UAVs进行硬件演示的首次实现。

**Title (ZH)**: WaveVerif: 基于声学侧信道的机器人工作流验证 

**Authors**: Zeynep Yasemin Erdogan, Shishir Nagaraja, Chuadhry Mujeeb Ahmed, Ryan Shah  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25960)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we present a framework that uses acoustic side- channel analysis (ASCA) to monitor and verify whether a robot correctly executes its intended commands. We develop and evaluate a machine-learning-based workflow verification system that uses acoustic emissions generated by robotic movements. The system can determine whether real-time behavior is consistent with expected commands. The evaluation takes into account movement speed, direction, and microphone distance. The results show that individual robot movements can be validated with over 80% accuracy under baseline conditions using four different classifiers: Support Vector Machine (SVM), Deep Neural Network (DNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Additionally, workflows such as pick-and-place and packing could be identified with similarly high confidence. Our findings demonstrate that acoustic signals can support real-time, low-cost, passive verification in sensitive robotic environments without requiring hardware modifications.

# Hybrid DQN-TD3 Reinforcement Learning for Autonomous Navigation in Dynamic Environments 

**Title (ZH)**: 混合DQN-TD3强化学习在动态环境中的自主导航 

**Authors**: Xiaoyi He, Danggui Chen, Zhenshuo Zhang, Zimeng Bai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.26646)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a hierarchical path-planning and control framework that combines a high-level Deep Q-Network (DQN) for discrete sub-goal selection with a low-level Twin Delayed Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (TD3) controller for continuous actuation. The high-level module selects behaviors and sub-goals; the low-level module executes smooth velocity commands. We design a practical reward shaping scheme (direction, distance, obstacle avoidance, action smoothness, collision penalty, time penalty, and progress), together with a LiDAR-based safety gate that prevents unsafe motions. The system is implemented in ROS + Gazebo (TurtleBot3) and evaluated with PathBench metrics, including success rate, collision rate, path efficiency, and re-planning efficiency, in dynamic and partially observable environments. Experiments show improved success rate and sample efficiency over single-algorithm baselines (DQN or TD3 alone) and rule-based planners, with better generalization to unseen obstacle configurations and reduced abrupt control changes. Code and evaluation scripts are available at the project repository. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 本文提出了一种分级路径规划与控制框架，该框架结合了高层次的深度Q网络（DQN）进行离散子目标选择和低层次的双延迟深度确定性策略梯度（TD3）控制器进行连续动作执行。高层次模块选择行为和子目标；低层次模块执行平滑的速度命令。我们设计了一个实用的奖励塑造方案（方向、距离、障碍物避免、动作平滑性、碰撞惩罚、时间惩罚和进程度），并配备了一个基于LiDAR的安全门，防止不安全的运动。该系统在ROS + Gazebo（TurtleBot3）上实现，并使用PathBench指标在动态和部分可观测环境中进行评估，包括成功率、碰撞率、路径效率和重规划效率。实验结果显示，该框架在单算法基线（单独的DQN或TD3）和基于规则的规划者上提高了成功率和样本效率，并且能够更好地泛化到未见过的障碍配置，并减少突然的控制变化。代码和评估脚本可在项目仓库中获得。
