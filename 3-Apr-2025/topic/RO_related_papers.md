**Abstract**: This paper presents field-tested use cases from Search and Rescue (SAR) missions, highlighting the co-design of mobile robots and communication systems to support Edge-Cloud architectures based on 5G Standalone (SA). The main goal is to contribute to the effective cooperation of multiple robots and first responders. Our field experience includes the development of Hybrid Wireless Sensor Networks (H-WSNs) for risk and victim detection, smartphones integrated into the Robot Operating System (ROS) as Edge devices for mission requests and path planning, real-time Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM) via Multi-Access Edge Computing (MEC), and implementation of Uncrewed Ground Vehicles (UGVs) for victim evacuation in different navigation modes. These experiments, conducted in collaboration with actual first responders, underscore the need for intelligent network resource management, balancing low-latency and high-bandwidth demands. Network slicing is key to ensuring critical emergency services are performed despite challenging communication conditions. The paper identifies architectural needs, lessons learned, and challenges to be addressed by 6G technologies to enhance emergency response capabilities.

**Title (ZH)**: 一种用于康复下肢外骨骼的新颖手势交互控制方法

**Abstract**: With the rapid development of Rehabilitation Lower Extremity Robotic Exoskeletons (RLEEX) technology, significant advancements have been made in Human-Robot Interaction (HRI) methods. These include traditional physical HRI methods that are easily recognizable and various bio-electrical signal-based HRI methods that can visualize and predict actions. However, most of these HRI methods are contact-based, facing challenges such as operational complexity, sensitivity to interference, risks associated with implantable devices, and, most importantly, limitations in comfort. These challenges render the interaction less intuitive and natural, which can negatively impact patient motivation for rehabilitation. To address these issues, this paper proposes a novel non-contact gesture interaction control method for RLEEX, based on RGB monocular camera depth estimation. This method integrates three key steps: detecting keypoints, recognizing gestures, and assessing distance, thereby applying gesture information and augmented reality triggering technology to control gait movements of RLEEX. Results indicate that this approach provides a feasible solution to the problems of poor comfort, low reliability, and high latency in HRI for RLEEX platforms. Specifically, it achieves a gesture-controlled exoskeleton motion accuracy of 94.11\% and an average system response time of 0.615 seconds through non-contact HRI. The proposed non-contact HRI method represents a pioneering advancement in control interactions for RLEEX, paving the way for further exploration and development in this field.

# Corner-Grasp: Multi-Action Grasp Detection and Active Gripper Adaptation for Grasping in Cluttered Environments 

**Title (ZH)**: 角落抓取：在拥挤环境中多动作抓取检测与主动 gripper 调适

**Abstract**: Robotic grasping is an essential capability, playing a critical role in enabling robots to physically interact with their surroundings. Despite extensive research, challenges remain due to the diverse shapes and properties of target objects, inaccuracies in sensing, and potential collisions with the environment. In this work, we propose a method for effectively grasping in cluttered bin-picking environments where these challenges intersect. We utilize a multi-functional gripper that combines both suction and finger grasping to handle a wide range of objects. We also present an active gripper adaptation strategy to minimize collisions between the gripper hardware and the surrounding environment by actively leveraging the reciprocating suction cup and reconfigurable finger motion. To fully utilize the gripper's capabilities, we built a neural network that detects suction and finger grasp points from a single input RGB-D image. This network is trained using a larger-scale synthetic dataset generated from simulation. In addition to this, we propose an efficient approach to constructing a real-world dataset that facilitates grasp point detection on various objects with diverse characteristics. Experiment results show that the proposed method can grasp objects in cluttered bin-picking scenarios and prevent collisions with environmental constraints such as a corner of the bin. Our proposed method demonstrated its effectiveness in the 9th Robotic Grasping and Manipulation Competition (RGMC) held at ICRA 2024.

# LL-Localizer: A Life-Long Localization System based on Dynamic i-Octree 

**Title (ZH)**: LL-Localizer: 一种基于动态i-Octree的终身定位系统 

**Authors**: Xinyi Li, Shenghai Yuan, Haoxin Cai, Shunan Lu, Wenhua Wang, Jianqi Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01583)  

**Abstract**: This paper proposes an incremental voxel-based life-long localization method, LL-Localizer, which enables robots to localize robustly and accurately in multi-session mode using prior maps. Meanwhile, considering that it is difficult to be aware of changes in the environment in the prior map and robots may traverse between mapped and unmapped areas during actual operation, we will update the map when needed according to the established strategies through incremental voxel map. Besides, to ensure high performance in real-time and facilitate our map management, we utilize Dynamic i-Octree, an efficient organization of 3D points based on Dynamic Octree to load local map and update the map during the robot's operation. The experiments show that our system can perform stable and accurate localization comparable to state-of-the-art LIO systems. And even if the environment in the prior map changes or the robots traverse between mapped and unmapped areas, our system can still maintain robust and accurate localization without any distinction. Our demo can be found on Blibili (this https URL) and youtube (this https URL) and the program will be available at this https URL.

# 8-DoFs Cable Driven Parallel Robots for Bimanual Teleportation 

**Title (ZH)**: 8-自由度缆索驱动并联机器人实现双臂远程传送 

**Authors**: Hung Hon Cheng, Josie Hughes  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01554)  

**Abstract**: Teleoperation plays a critical role in intuitive robot control and imitation learning, particularly for complex tasks involving mobile manipulators with redundant degrees of freedom (DoFs). However, most existing master controllers are limited to 6-DoF spatial control and basic gripper control, making them insufficient for controlling high-DoF robots and restricting the operator to a small workspace. In this work, we present a novel, low-cost, high-DoF master controller based on Cable-Driven Parallel Robots (CDPRs), designed to overcome these limitations. The system decouples translation and orientation control, following a scalable 3 + 3 + n DoF structure: 3 DoFs for large-range translation using a CDPR, 3 DoFs for orientation using a gimbal mechanism, and n additional DoFs for gripper and redundant joint control. Its lightweight cable-driven design enables a large and adaptable workspace while minimizing actuator load. The end-effector remains stable without requiring continuous high-torque input, unlike most serial robot arms. We developed the first dual-arm CDPR-based master controller using cost-effective actuators and a simple mechanical structure. In demonstrations, the system successfully controlled an 8-DoF robotic arm with a 2-DoF pan-tilt camera, performing tasks such as pick-and-place, knot tying, object sorting, and tape application. The results show precise, versatile, and practical high-DoF teleoperation.

**Abstract**: The logarithmic spiral is observed as a common pattern in several living beings across kingdoms and species. Some examples include fern shoots, prehensile tails, and soft limbs like octopus arms and elephant trunks. In the latter cases, spiraling is also used for grasping. Motivated by how this strategy simplifies behavior into kinematic primitives and combines them to develop smart grasping movements, this work focuses on the elephant trunk, which is more deeply investigated in the literature. We present a soft arm combined with a rigid robotic system to replicate elephant grasping capabilities based on the combination of a soft trunk with a solid body. In our system, the rigid arm ensures positioning and orientation, mimicking the role of the elephant's head, while the soft manipulator reproduces trunk motion primitives of bending and twisting under proper actuation patterns. This synergy replicates 9 distinct elephant grasping strategies reported in the literature, accommodating objects of varying shapes and sizes. The synergistic interaction between the rigid and soft components of the system minimizes the control complexity while maintaining a high degree of adaptability.

**Abstract**: Considering the widespread integration of aerial robots in inspection, search and rescue, and monitoring tasks, there is a growing demand to design intuitive human-drone interfaces. These aim to streamline and enhance the user interaction and collaboration process during drone navigation, ultimately expediting mission success and accommodating users' inputs. In this paper, we present a novel human-drone mixed reality interface that aims to (a) increase human-drone spatial awareness by sharing relevant spatial information and representations between the human equipped with a Head Mounted Display (HMD) and the robot and (b) enable safer and intuitive human-drone interactive and collaborative navigation in unknown environments beyond the simple command and control or teleoperation paradigm. We validate our framework through extensive user studies and experiments in a simulated post-disaster scenarios, comparing its performance against a traditional First-Person View (FPV) control systems. Furthermore, multiple tests on several users underscore the advantages of the proposed solution, which offers intuitive and natural interaction with the system. This demonstrates the solution's ability to assist humans during a drone navigation mission, ensuring its safe and effective execution.

# AIM: Acoustic Inertial Measurement for Indoor Drone Localization and Tracking 

**Title (ZH)**: AIM: 室内无人机定位与跟踪的声学惯性测量 

**Authors**: Yimiao Sun, Weiguo Wang, Luca Mottola, Ruijin Wang, Yuan He  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2504.01297)  

**Abstract**: We present Acoustic Inertial Measurement (AIM), a one-of-a-kind technique for indoor drone localization and tracking. Indoor drone localization and tracking are arguably a crucial, yet unsolved challenge: in GPS-denied environments, existing approaches enjoy limited applicability, especially in Non-Line of Sight (NLoS), require extensive environment instrumentation, or demand considerable hardware/software changes on drones. In contrast, AIM exploits the acoustic characteristics of the drones to estimate their location and derive their motion, even in NLoS settings. We tame location estimation errors using a dedicated Kalman filter and the Interquartile Range rule (IQR). We implement AIM using an off-the-shelf microphone array and evaluate its performance with a commercial drone under varied settings. Results indicate that the mean localization error of AIM is 46% lower than commercial UWB-based systems in complex indoor scenarios, where state-of-the-art infrared systems would not even work because of NLoS settings. We further demonstrate that AIM can be extended to support indoor spaces with arbitrary ranges and layouts without loss of accuracy by deploying distributed microphone arrays.

**Abstract**: Soft pneumatic actuators (SPA) made from elastomeric materials can provide large strain and large force. The behavior of locally strain-restricted hyperelastic materials under inflation has been investigated thoroughly for shape reconfiguration, but requires further investigation for trajectories involving external force. In this work we model force-pressure-height relationships for a concentrically strain-limited class of soft pneumatic actuators and demonstrate the use of this model to design SPA response for object lifting. We predict relationships under different loadings by solving energy minimization equations and verify this theory by using an automated test rig to collect rich data for n=22 Ecoflex 00-30 membranes. We collect this data using an active learning pipeline to efficiently model the design space. We show that this learned material model outperforms the theory-based model and naive curve-fitting approaches. We use our model to optimize membrane design for different lift tasks and compare this performance to other designs. These contributions represent a step towards understanding the natural response for this class of actuator and embodying intelligent lifts in a single-pressure input actuator system.
