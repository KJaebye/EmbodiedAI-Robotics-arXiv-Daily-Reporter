**Abstract**: This work presents KnotDLO, a method for one-handed Deformable Linear Object (DLO) knot tying that is robust to occlusion, repeatable for varying rope initial configurations, interpretable for generating motion policies, and requires no human demonstrations or training. Grasp and target waypoints for future DLO states are planned from the current DLO shape. Grasp poses are computed from indexing the tracked piecewise linear curve representing the DLO state based on the current curve shape and are piecewise continuous. KnotDLO computes intermediate waypoints from the geometry of the current DLO state and the desired next state. The system decouples visual reasoning from control. In 16 trials of knot tying, KnotDLO achieves a 50% success rate in tying an overhand knot from previously unseen configurations.

**Abstract**: The transport industry has recently shown significant interest in unmanned surface vehicles (USVs), specifically for port and inland waterway transport. These systems can improve operational efficiency and safety, which is especially relevant in the European Union, where initiatives such as the Green Deal are driving a shift towards increased use of inland waterways. At the same time, a shortage of qualified personnel is accelerating the adoption of autonomous solutions. However, there is a notable lack of open-source, high-fidelity simulation frameworks and datasets for developing and evaluating such solutions. To address these challenges, we introduce AirSim For Surface Vehicles (ASVSim), an open-source simulation framework specifically designed for autonomous shipping research in inland and port environments. The framework combines simulated vessel dynamics with marine sensor simulation capabilities, including radar and camera systems and supports the generation of synthetic datasets for training computer vision models and reinforcement learning agents. Built upon Cosys-AirSim, ASVSim provides a comprehensive platform for developing autonomous navigation algorithms and generating synthetic datasets. The simulator supports research of both traditional control methods and deep learning-based approaches. Through limited experiments, we demonstrate the potential of the simulator in these research areas. ASVSim is provided as an open-source project under the MIT license, making autonomous navigation research accessible to a larger part of the ocean engineering community.

**Abstract**: Zero-order optimization techniques are becoming increasingly popular in robotics due to their ability to handle non-differentiable functions and escape local minima. These advantages make them particularly useful for trajectory optimization and policy optimization. In this work, we propose a mathematical tutorial on random search. It offers a simple and unifying perspective for understanding a wide range of algorithms commonly used in robotics. Leveraging this viewpoint, we classify many trajectory optimization methods under a common framework and derive novel competitive RL algorithms.

**Abstract**: Robotic teleoperation over long communication distances poses challenges due to delays in commands and feedback from network latency. One simple yet effective strategy to reduce errors and increase performance under delay is to downscale the relative motion between the operating surgeon and the robot. The question remains as to what is the optimal scaling factor, and how this value changes depending on the level of latency as well as operator tendencies. We present user studies investigating the relationship between latency, scaling factor, and performance. The results of our studies demonstrate a statistically significant difference in performance between users and across scaling factors for certain levels of delay. These findings indicate that the optimal scaling factor for a given level of delay is specific to each user, motivating the need for personalized models for optimal performance. We present techniques to model the user-specific mapping of latency level to scaling factor for optimal performance, leading to an efficient and effective solution to optimizing performance of robotic teleoperation and specifically telesurgery under large communication delay. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 长距离通信下机器人远程操作由于网络延迟导致的命令和反馈延迟提出了挑战。一种简单有效的策略是在存在延迟的情况下减少操作外科医生与机器人之间的相对运动以减少错误和提高性能。问题在于最优缩放因子是多少，以及这种值如何随着延迟程度和操作者的倾向发生变化。我们进行了用户研究以探讨延迟、缩放因子与性能之间的关系。我们的研究结果表明，在某些延迟水平上，用户之间的性能以及不同的缩放因子之间存在统计学意义上的显著差异。这些发现表明，对于给定的延迟水平，最优缩放因子对每位用户都是特定的，这驱使我们建立个性化的模型以实现最优性能。我们提出了建模用户特定的延迟水平到最优缩放因子映射的技术，从而为在大通信延迟下优化机器人远程操作和远程外科手术的性能提供了高效而有效的解决方案。

# AeroLite-MDNet: Lightweight Multi-task Deviation Detection Network for UAV Landing 

**Title (ZH)**: AeroLite-MDNet：轻量级多任务偏差检测网络用于无人机着陆 

**Authors**: Haiping Yang, Huaxing Liu, Wei Wu, Zuohui Chen, Ning Wu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.21635)  

**Abstract**: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly employed in diverse applications such as land surveying, material transport, and environmental monitoring. Following missions like data collection or inspection, UAVs must land safely at docking stations for storage or recharging, which is an essential requirement for ensuring operational continuity. However, accurate landing remains challenging due to factors like GPS signal interference. To address this issue, we propose a deviation warning system for UAV landings, powered by a novel vision-based model called AeroLite-MDNet. This model integrates a multiscale fusion module for robust cross-scale object detection and incorporates a segmentation branch for efficient orientation estimation. We introduce a new evaluation metric, Average Warning Delay (AWD), to quantify the system's sensitivity to landing deviations. Furthermore, we contribute a new dataset, UAVLandData, which captures real-world landing deviation scenarios to support training and evaluation. Experimental results show that our system achieves an AWD of 0.7 seconds with a deviation detection accuracy of 98.6\%, demonstrating its effectiveness in enhancing UAV landing reliability.

**Abstract (ZH)**: 无人驾驶航空器（UAVs）在土地测验、物资运输和环境监测等多种应用中越来越广泛。在完成数据收集或检查任务后，UAVs必须准确地降落在指定的停机站进行存储或充电，这是确保操作连续性的基本要求。然而，由于GPS信号干扰等因素，精确的降落仍然是一个挑战。为了解决这一问题，我们提出了一种基于新型视觉模型AeroLite-MDNet的偏移警告系统。该模型结合了多尺度融合模块进行稳健的跨尺度对象检测，并包含分割分支进行高效的姿态估计。我们引入了一种新的评价指标，平均警告延迟（AWD），以量化系统对降落偏差的敏感度。此外，我们贡献了一个新的数据集UAVLandData，该数据集捕捉了真实世界的降落偏差场景，以支持训练和评估。实验结果表明，我们的系统实现了0.7秒的AWD和98.6%的偏差检测准确率，证明了其在提高UAV降落可靠性方面的有效性。代码将发布在以下链接：this https URL。

# ARMOR: Robust Reinforcement Learning-based Control for UAVs under Physical Attacks 

**Title (ZH)**: ARMOR：在物理攻击下的鲁棒强化学习控制方法针对无人机 

**Authors**: Pritam Dash, Ethan Chan, Nathan P. Lawrence, Karthik Pattabiraman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2506.22423)  

**Abstract**: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) depend on onboard sensors for perception, navigation, and control. However, these sensors are susceptible to physical attacks, such as GPS spoofing, that can corrupt state estimates and lead to unsafe behavior. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers adaptive control capabilities, existing safe RL methods are ineffective against such attacks. We present ARMOR (Adaptive Robust Manipulation-Optimized State Representations), an attack-resilient, model-free RL controller that enables robust UAV operation under adversarial sensor manipulation. Instead of relying on raw sensor observations, ARMOR learns a robust latent representation of the UAV's physical state via a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, a teacher encoder, trained with privileged attack information, generates attack-aware latent states for RL policy training. In the second stage, a student encoder is trained via supervised learning to approximate the teacher's latent states using only historical sensor data, enabling real-world deployment without privileged information. Our experiments show that ARMOR outperforms conventional methods, ensuring UAV safety. Additionally, ARMOR improves generalization to unseen attacks and reduces training cost by eliminating the need for iterative adversarial training.

**Title (ZH)**: Ark：一种基于Python的机器人学习开源框架 

**Authors**: Magnus Dierking, Christopher E. Mower, Sarthak Das, Huang Helong, Jiacheng Qiu, Cody Reading, Wei Chen, Huidong Liang, Huang Guowei, Jan Peters, Quan Xingyue, Jun Wang, Haitham Bou-Ammar

**Abstract**: Robotics has made remarkable hardware strides-from DARPA's Urban and Robotics Challenges to the first humanoid-robot kickboxing tournament-yet commercial autonomy still lags behind progress in machine learning. A major bottleneck is software: current robot stacks demand steep learning curves, low-level C/C++ expertise, fragmented tooling, and intricate hardware integration, in stark contrast to the Python-centric, well-documented ecosystems that propelled modern AI. We introduce ARK, an open-source, Python-first robotics framework designed to close that gap. ARK presents a Gym-style environment interface that allows users to collect data, preprocess it, and train policies using state-of-the-art imitation-learning algorithms (e.g., ACT, Diffusion Policy) while seamlessly toggling between high-fidelity simulation and physical robots. A lightweight client-server architecture provides networked publisher-subscriber communication, and optional C/C++ bindings ensure real-time performance when needed. ARK ships with reusable modules for control, SLAM, motion planning, system identification, and visualization, along with native ROS interoperability. Comprehensive documentation and case studies-from manipulation to mobile navigation-demonstrate rapid prototyping, effortless hardware swapping, and end-to-end pipelines that rival the convenience of mainstream machine-learning workflows. By unifying robotics and AI practices under a common Python umbrella, ARK lowers entry barriers and accelerates research and commercial deployment of autonomous robots. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 机器人技术在从DARPA的城市挑战和机器人挑战到首个类人机器人踢拳锦标赛中取得了显著的硬件进步，然而商业自主性仍然落后于机器学习的进步。主要瓶颈在于软件：当前的机器人堆栈要求陡峭的学习曲线、低级的C/C++专门知识、散乱的工具以及复杂的硬件集成，这与以Python为中心、文档丰富的生态系统形成了鲜明对比，后者推动了现代人工智能的发展。我们引入了ARK，一个开源的、以Python为主的机器人框架，旨在弥合这一差距。ARK提供了一种类似Gym的环境接口，允许用户收集数据、预处理数据并使用最先进的模仿学习算法（例如ACT、扩散策略）训练策略，同时无缝切换高保真模拟和物理机器人。轻量级的客户端-服务器架构提供了网络化的发布者-订阅者通信，而可选的C/C++绑定确保在需要时提供实时性能。ARK附带了可重用的控制、SLAM、运动规划、系统辨识和可视化模块，并具备原生ROS互操作性。全面的文档和案例研究（涵盖从操作到移动导航）展示了快速原型制作、轻松更换硬件和端到端工作流的便捷性，后者与主流机器学习工作流程相当。通过在共同的Python伞下统一机器人技术和人工智能实践，ARK降低了准入门槛并加速了自主机器人的研究和商业部署。
