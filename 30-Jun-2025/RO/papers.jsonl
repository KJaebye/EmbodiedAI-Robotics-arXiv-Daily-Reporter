Ray, Muthukumar Bagavathiannan', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22364', 'abstract': 'Accurate weed management is essential for mitigating significant crop yield losses, necessitating effective weed suppression strategies in agricultural systems. Integrating cover crops (CC) offers multiple benefits, including soil erosion reduction, weed suppression, decreased nitrogen requirements, and enhanced carbon sequestration, all of which are closely tied to the aboveground biomass (AGB) they produce. However, biomass production varies significantly due to microsite variability, making accurate estimation and mapping essential for identifying zones of poor weed suppression and optimizing targeted management strategies. To address this challenge, developing a comprehensive CC map, including its AGB distribution, will enable informed decision-making regarding weed control methods and optimal application rates. Manual visual inspection is impractical and labor-intensive, especially given the extensive field size and the wide diversity and variation of weed species and sizes. In this context, optical imagery and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) data are two prominent sources with unique characteristics that enhance AGB estimation. This study introduces a ground robot-mounted multimodal sensor system designed for agricultural field mapping. The system integrates optical and LiDAR data, leveraging machine learning (ML) methods for data fusion to improve biomass predictions. The best ML-based model for dry AGB estimation achieved a coefficient of determination value of 0.88, demonstrating robust performance in diverse field conditions.

In this letter, a surface optimal path planning algorithm called RM-Dijkstra is proposed, which is based on Riemannian metric model. By constructing a new Riemannian metric on the 2D projection plane, the surface optimal path planning problem is therefore transformed into a geometric problem on the 2D plane with new Riemannian metric. Induced by the standard Euclidean metric on surface, the constructed new metric reflects environmental information of the robot and ensures that the projection map is an isometric immersion. By conducting a series of simulation tests, the experimental results demonstrate that the RM-Dijkstra algorithm not only effectively solves the optimal path planning problem on surfaces, but also outperforms traditional path planning algorithms in terms of path accuracy and smoothness, particularly in complex scenarios.', 'abstract_zh': '刘iemannian度量模型的表面最优路径规划算法', 'title_zh': 'RM-Dijkstra: 基于黎曼度量的曲面最优路径规划算法'}

It is widely recognized that achieving human-like efficiency and robustness manipulation requires the robotic brain to integrate a comprehensive set of functions, such as task planning, policy generation, anomaly monitoring and handling, and long-term memory, achieving high-efficiency operation across all functions. Vision-Language Models (VLMs), pretrained on massive multimodal data, have acquired rich world knowledge, exhibiting exceptional scene understanding and multimodal reasoning capabilities. However, existing methods typically focus on realizing only a single function or a subset of functions within the robotic brain, without integrating them into a unified cognitive architecture. Inspired by a divide-and-conquer strategy and the architecture of the human brain, we propose FrankenBot, a VLM-driven, brain-morphic robotic manipulation framework that achieves both comprehensive functionality and high operational efficiency. Our framework includes a suite of components, decoupling a part of key functions from frequent VLM calls, striking an optimal balance between functional completeness and system efficiency. Specifically, we map task planning, policy generation, memory management, and low-level interfacing to the cortex, cerebellum, temporal lobe-hippocampus complex, and brainstem, respectively, and design efficient coordination mechanisms for the modules. We conducted comprehensive experiments in both simulation and real-world robotic environments, demonstrating that our method offers significant advantages in anomaly detection and handling, long-term memory, operational efficiency, and stability -- all without requiring any fine-tuning or retraining.', 'abstract_zh': '开发一种能够在复杂、动态和非结构化真实环境中执行广泛任务的一般机器人操作系统一直是具有挑战性的任务。广泛认为，实现类似于人类的操作效率和鲁棒性要求机器人智能体整合一系列功能，如任务规划、策略生成、异常监测与处理以及长时记忆，并在所有功能上实现高效运作。视觉-语言模型（VLMs）在大量多模态数据上进行预训练，获取丰富的世界知识，表现出卓越的场景理解和多模态推理能力。然而，现有方法通常仅专注于实现机器人智能体中的单一功能或部分功能，而没有将它们整合到统一的认知架构中。受分而治之策略和人脑结构的启发，我们提出了一种由VLM驱动、仿脑型的机器人操作框架FrankenBot，该框架实现了全面的功能和高效的运作。我们框架包括一系列组件，将部分关键功能从频繁的VLM调用中解耦出来，平衡了功能完整性与系统效率。具体来说，我们将任务规划、策略生成、记忆管理以及低级接口分别映射到大脑皮层、小脑、海马体-颞叶复合体和脑干，并设计了高效的模块协调机制。我们在模拟和真实的机器人环境中进行了全面的实验，证明了该方法在异常检测与处理、长时记忆、运作效率和稳定性方面具有显著优势，且无需进行任何微调或重新训练。', 'title_zh': 'FrankenBot：基于大脑形态模块化 orchestration 的视觉语言模型驱动的机器人操作'}

Lawrence, Karthik Pattabiraman', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22423', 'abstract': "Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) depend on onboard sensors for perception, navigation, and control. However, these sensors are susceptible to physical attacks, such as GPS spoofing, that can corrupt state estimates and lead to unsafe behavior. While reinforcement learning (RL) offers adaptive control capabilities, existing safe RL methods are ineffective against such attacks. We present ARMOR (Adaptive Robust Manipulation-Optimized State Representations), an attack-resilient, model-free RL controller that enables robust UAV operation under adversarial sensor manipulation. Instead of relying on raw sensor observations, ARMOR learns a robust latent representation of the UAV's physical state via a two-stage training framework. In the first stage, a teacher encoder, trained with privileged attack information, generates attack-aware latent states for RL policy training. In the second stage, a student encoder is trained via supervised learning to approximate the teacher's latent states using only historical sensor data, enabling real-world deployment without privileged information. Our experiments show that ARMOR outperforms conventional methods, ensuring UAV safety. Additionally, ARMOR improves generalization to unseen attacks and reduces training cost by eliminating the need for iterative adversarial training.", 'abstract_zh': '基于攻击鲁棒性、模型自由的强化学习控制器：适应敌对传感器操纵的无人机稳健操作（Attack-Resilient, Model-Free RL Controller for Adaptive Robust Manipulation-Optimized State Representations Enabling Robust UAV Operation Under Adversarial Sensor Manipulation）', 'title_zh': 'ARMOR：在物理攻击下的鲁棒强化学习控制方法针对无人机'}

However, the current practice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases inevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them prohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to distill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics priors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable and naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into an implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional physical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a physics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to indoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic integration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful features from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic programming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a low-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL consistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces training time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases.', 'abstract_zh': '基于物理信息程序引导的强化学习（PiPRL）方法在室内导航中的应用', 'title_zh': '基于物理 informant 符号程序先验的零样本无线室内导航强化学习'}

To mitigate the challenge of a limited field of view in single-image intraoperative scenarios, multi-view 2D/3D registration is required by leveraging multiple intraoperative images. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-view 2D/3D rigid registration approach comprising two stages. In the first stage, a combined loss function is designed, incorporating both the differences between predicted and ground-truth poses and the dissimilarities (e.g., normalized cross-correlation) between simulated and observed intraoperative images. More importantly, additional cross-view training loss terms are introduced for both pose and image losses to explicitly enforce cross-view constraints. In the second stage, test-time optimization is performed to refine the estimated poses from the coarse stage. Our method exploits the mutual constraints of multi-view projection poses to enhance the robustness of the registration process.
