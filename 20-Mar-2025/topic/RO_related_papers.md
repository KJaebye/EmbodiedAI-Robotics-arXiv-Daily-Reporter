**Abstract**: The integration of extra-robotic limbs/fingers to enhance and expand motor skills, particularly for grasping and manipulation, possesses significant challenges. The grasping performance of existing limbs/fingers is far inferior to that of human hands. Human hands can detect onset of slip through tactile feedback originating from tactile receptors during the grasping process, enabling precise and automatic regulation of grip force. The frictional information is perceived by humans depending upon slip happening between finger and object. Enhancing this capability in extra-robotic limbs or fingers used by humans is challenging. To address this challenge, this paper introduces novel approach to communicate frictional information to users through encoded vibrotactile cues. These cues are conveyed on onset of incipient slip thus allowing users to perceive friction and ultimately use this information to increase force to avoid dropping of object. In a 2-alternative forced-choice protocol, participants gripped and lifted a glass under three different frictional conditions, applying a normal force of 3.5 N. After reaching this force, glass was gradually released to induce slip. During this slipping phase, vibrations scaled according to static coefficient of friction were presented to users, reflecting frictional conditions. The results suggested an accuracy of 94.53 p/m 3.05 (mean p/mSD) in perceiving frictional information upon lifting objects with varying friction. The results indicate effectiveness of using vibrotactile feedback for sensory feedback, allowing users of extra-robotic limbs or fingers to perceive frictional information. This enables them to assess surface properties and adjust grip force according to frictional conditions, enhancing their ability to grasp, manipulate objects more effectively. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 将额外的机械臂/手指集成以增强和扩展运动技能，特别是抓取和操作能力，面临着重大挑战。现有的机械臂/手指的抓取性能远不及人类的手。人类在抓取过程中通过触觉反馈中的触觉感受器检测滑动的开始，能够精确并自动调节握力。人类根据手指与物体之间的滑动感知摩擦信息。增强人类使用的额外机械臂或手指的这种能力具有挑战性。为应对这一挑战，本文提出了一种通过编码振动触觉提示传递摩擦信息的新方法。这些提示在滑动即将开始时传达给用户，从而使用户能够感知摩擦，并最终利用这些信息增加力量以避免物体掉落。在2选1的强迫选择协议中，参与者在三种不同的摩擦条件下抓取并举起一个玻璃杯，施加一个正常的3.5 N的力。达到这一力后，玻璃杯逐渐释放以引起滑动。在滑动阶段，根据静摩擦系数的比例呈现振动，反映了摩擦条件。结果显示，在举起具有不同摩擦的物体时，用户感知摩擦信息的准确性为94.53 ± 3.05。结果表明，使用振动触觉反馈作为感觉反馈是有效的，使使用额外机械臂或手指的用户能够感知摩擦信息，从而评估表面属性并根据摩擦条件调整握力，增强他们更有效地抓取和操作物体的能力。

# Online Imitation Learning for Manipulation via Decaying Relative Correction through Teleoperation 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于电信操作的递减相对校正在线模仿学习 manipulotion 研究 

**Authors**: Cheng Pan, Hung Hon Cheng, Josie Hughes  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15368)  

**Abstract**: Teleoperated robotic manipulators enable the collection of demonstration data, which can be used to train control policies through imitation learning. However, such methods can require significant amounts of training data to develop robust policies or adapt them to new and unseen tasks. While expert feedback can significantly enhance policy performance, providing continuous feedback can be cognitively demanding and time-consuming for experts. To address this challenge, we propose to use a cable-driven teleoperation system which can provide spatial corrections with 6 degree of freedom to the trajectories generated by a policy model. Specifically, we propose a correction method termed Decaying Relative Correction (DRC) which is based upon the spatial offset vector provided by the expert and exists temporarily, and which reduces the intervention steps required by an expert. Our results demonstrate that DRC reduces the required expert intervention rate by 30\% compared to a standard absolute corrective method. Furthermore, we show that integrating DRC within an online imitation learning framework rapidly increases the success rate of manipulation tasks such as raspberry harvesting and cloth wiping.

# Perception-aware Planning for Quadrotor Flight in Unknown and Feature-limited Environments 

**Title (ZH)**: 未知且特征限制环境下基于感知的四旋翼飞行规划 

**Authors**: Chenxin Yu, Zihong Lu, Jie Mei, Boyu Zhou  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15273)  

**Abstract**: Various studies on perception-aware planning have been proposed to enhance the state estimation accuracy of quadrotors in visually degraded environments. However, many existing methods heavily rely on prior environmental knowledge and face significant limitations in previously unknown environments with sparse localization features, which greatly limits their practical application. In this paper, we present a perception-aware planning method for quadrotor flight in unknown and feature-limited environments that properly allocates perception resources among environmental information during navigation. We introduce a viewpoint transition graph that allows for the adaptive selection of local target viewpoints, which guide the quadrotor to efficiently navigate to the goal while maintaining sufficient localizability and without being trapped in feature-limited regions. During the local planning, a novel yaw trajectory generation method that simultaneously considers exploration capability and localizability is presented. It constructs a localizable corridor via feature co-visibility evaluation to ensure localization robustness in a computationally efficient way. Through validations conducted in both simulation and real-world experiments, we demonstrate the feasibility and real-time performance of the proposed method. The source code will be released to benefit the community.

**Abstract**: Ease of programming is a key factor in making robots ubiquitous in unstructured environments. In this work, we present a sensorized gripper built with off-the-shelf parts, used to record human demonstrations of a box in box assembly task. With very few trials of short interval timings each, we show that a robot can repeat the task successfully. We adopt a Cartesian approach to robot motion generation by computing the joint space solution while concurrently solving for the optimal robot position, to maximise manipulability. The statistics of the human demonstration are extracted using Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) and the robot is commanded using impedance control.

# Geometric Iterative Approach for Efficient Inverse Kinematics and Planning of Continuum Robots with a Floating Base Under Environment Constraints 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于环境约束的浮动基座连续机器人高效逆动力学及运动规划的几何迭代方法 

**Authors**: Congjun Ma, Quan Xiao, Liangcheng Liu, Xingxing You, Songyi Dian  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14848)  

**Abstract**: Continuum robots with floating bases demonstrate exceptional operational capabilities in confined spaces, such as those encountered in medical surgeries and equipment maintenance. However, developing low-cost solutions for their motion and planning problems remains a significant challenge in this field. This paper investigates the application of geometric iterative strategy methods to continuum robots, and proposes the algorithm based on an improved two-layer geometric iterative strategy for motion planning. First, we thoroughly study the kinematics and effective workspace of a multi-segment tendon-driven continuum robot with a floating base. Then, generalized iterative algorithms for solving arbitrary-segment continuum robots are proposed based on a series of problems such as initial arm shape dependence exhibited by similar methods when applied to continuum robots. Further, the task scenario is extended to a follow-the-leader task considering environmental factors, and further extended algorithm are proposed. Simulation comparison results with similar methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in eliminating the initial arm shape dependence and improving the solution efficiency and accuracy. The experimental results further demonstrate that the method based on improved two-layer geometric iteration can be used for motion planning task of a continuum robot with a floating base, under an average deviation of about 4 mm in the end position, an average orientation deviation of no more than 1 degree, and the reduction of average number of iterations and time cost is 127.4 iterations and 72.6 ms compared with similar methods, respectively.

**Title (ZH)**: 人类与群无人机交互研究：一种评估情况意识和任务绩效的框架 

**Authors**: Wasura D. Wattearachchi, Erandi Lakshika, Kathryn Kasmarik, Michael Barlow  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14810)  

**Abstract**: This paper introduces a framework for human swarm interaction studies that measures situation awareness in dynamic environments. A tablet-based interface was developed for a user study by implementing the concepts introduced in the framework, where operators guided a robotic swarm in a single-target search task, marking hazardous cells unknown to the swarm. Both subjective and objective situation awareness measures were used, with task performance evaluated based on how close the robots were to the target. The framework enabled a structured investigation of the role of situation awareness in human swarm interaction, leading to key findings such as improved task performance across attempts, showing the interface was learnable, centroid active robot position proved to be a useful task performance metric for assessing situation awareness, perception and projection played a key role in task performance, highlighting their importance in interface design and both subjective and objective situation awareness influenced task performance, emphasizing the need for interfaces that support both. These findings validate our framework as a structured approach for integrating situation awareness concepts into human swarm interaction studies, offering a systematic way to assess situation awareness and task performance. The framework can be applied to other swarming studies to evaluate interface learnability, identify meaningful task performance metrics, and refine interface designs to enhance situation awareness, ultimately improving human swarm interaction in dynamic environments.

# A Constrained Saddle Search Approach for Constructing Singular and Flexible Bar Frameworks 

**Title (ZH)**: 一种构建奇异且可调桁架结构的约束鞍点搜索方法 

**Authors**: Xuenan Li, Mihnea Leonte, Christian D. Santangelo, Miranda Holmes-Cerfon  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14807)  

**Abstract**: Singularity analysis is essential in robot kinematics, as singular configurations cause loss of control and kinematic indeterminacy. This paper models singularities in bar frameworks as saddle points on constrained manifolds. Given an under-constrained, non-singular bar framework, by allowing one edge to vary its length while fixing lengths of others, we define the squared length of the free edge as an energy functional and show that its local saddle points correspond to singular and flexible frameworks. Using our constrained saddle search approach, we identify previously unknown singular and flexible bar frameworks, providing new insights into singular robotics design and analysis.

# Nonlinear Modeling and Observability of a Planar Multi-Link Robot with Link Thrusters 

**Title (ZH)**: 平面多连杆推进器机器人非线性建模与可观测性研究 

**Authors**: Nicholas B. Andrews, Kristi A. Morgansen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14790)  

**Abstract**: This work is motivated by the development of cooperative teams of small, soft underwater robots designed to accomplish complex tasks through collective behavior. These robots take inspiration from biology: salps are gelatinous, jellyfish-like marine animals that utilize jet propulsion for maneuvering and can physically connect to form dynamic chains of arbitrary shape and size. The primary contributions of this research are twofold: first, we adapt a planar nonlinear multi-link snake robot model to model a planar multi-link salp-inspired system by removing joint actuators, introducing link thrusters, and allowing for non-uniform link lengths, masses, and moments of inertia. Second, we conduct a nonlinear observability analysis of the multi-link system with link thrusters, showing that the link angles, angular velocities, masses, and moments of inertia are locally observable when equipped with inertial measurement units and operating under specific thruster conditions. This research provides a theoretical foundation for modeling and estimating both the state and intrinsic parameters of a multi-link system with link thrusters, which are essential for effective controller design and performance.

# Dexterous Control of an 11-DOF Redundant Robot for CT-Guided Needle Insertion With Task-Oriented Weighted Policies 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于任务导向加权策略的11自由度冗余机器人在CT引导下穿针操作的灵巧控制 

**Authors**: Peihan Zhang, Florian Richter, Ishan Duriseti, Michael Yip  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14753)  

**Abstract**: Computed tomography (CT)-guided needle biopsies are critical for diagnosing a range of conditions, including lung cancer, but present challenges such as limited in-bore space, prolonged procedure times, and radiation exposure. Robotic assistance offers a promising solution by improving needle trajectory accuracy, reducing radiation exposure, and enabling real-time adjustments. In our previous work, we introduced a redundant robotic platform designed for dexterous needle insertion within the confined CT bore. However, its limited base mobility restricts flexible deployment in clinical settings. In this study, we present an improved 11-degree-of-freedom (DOF) robotic system that integrates a 6-DOF robotic base with a 5-DOF cable-driven end-effector, significantly enhancing workspace flexibility and precision. With the hyper-redundant degrees of freedom, we introduce a weighted inverse kinematics controller with a two-stage priority scheme for large-scale movement and fine in-bore adjustments, along with a null-space control strategy to optimize dexterity. We validate our system through both simulation and real-world experiments, demonstrating superior tracking accuracy and enhanced manipulability in CT-guided procedures. The study provides a strong case for hyper-redundancy and null-space control formulations for robot-assisted needle biopsy scenarios.

**Authors**: Mehdi Delrobaei, Kenneth McIsaac  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14727)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents an autonomous parking control system for an active-joint center-articulated mobile robot. We begin by proposing a kinematic model of the robot, then derive a control law designed to stabilize the vehicle's configuration within a small neighborhood of the target position. The control law is developed using Lyapunov techniques and is based on the robot's equations of motion in polar coordinates. Additionally, a beacon-based guidance system provides real-time feedback on the target's position and orientation. Simulation results demonstrate the robot's capability to start from arbitrary initial positions and orientations and successfully achieve parking.

# Using Mobile AR for Rapid Feasibility Analysis for Deployment of Robots: A Usability Study with Non-Expert Users 

**Title (ZH)**: 使用移动AR进行机器人部署快速可行性分析：非专家用户可用性研究 

**Authors**: Krzysztof Zielinski, Slawomir Tadeja, Bruce Blumberg, Mikkel Baun Kjærgaard  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14725)  

**Abstract**: Automating a production line with robotic arms is a complex, demanding task that requires not only substantial resources but also a deep understanding of the automated processes and available technologies and tools. Expert integrators must consider factors such as placement, payload, and robot reach requirements to determine the feasibility of automation. Ideally, such considerations are based on a detailed digital simulation developed before any hardware is deployed. However, this process is often time-consuming and challenging. To simplify these processes, we introduce a much simpler method for the feasibility analysis of robotic arms' reachability, designed for non-experts. We implement this method through a mobile, sensing-based prototype tool. The two-step experimental evaluation included the expert user study results, which helped us identify the difficulty levels of various deployment scenarios and refine the initial prototype. The results of the subsequent quantitative study with 22 non-expert participants utilizing both scenarios indicate that users could complete both simple and complex feasibility analyses in under ten minutes, exhibiting similar cognitive loads and high engagement. Overall, the results suggest that the tool was well-received and rated as highly usable, thereby showing a new path for changing the ease of feasibility analysis for automation. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 使用机器人手臂自动化生产线是一项复杂且 demanding 的任务，需要大量资源以及对自动化过程和可用技术及工具的深刻理解。专家集成商必须考虑诸如位置、负载和机器人工作范围等因素，以确定自动化可行性。理想情况下，这些考虑是在任何硬件部署之前基于详细的数字模拟进行的。然而，这一过程往往耗时且具有挑战性。为了简化这些过程，我们介绍了一种更简单的方法，用于非专家进行机器人手臂可达性的可行性分析。我们通过一个基于移动传感的原型工具实现了这种方法。实验评估包括两步专家用户研究，帮助我们识别各种部署场景的难度并改进初始原型。后续使用 22 名非专家参与者进行的定量研究结果显示，用户可以在不到十分钟的时间内完成简单和复杂的可行性分析，表现出相似的认知负担和高参与度。总体而言，结果表明该工具受到了欢迎并被认为是高度可用的，从而为改变自动化可行性分析的便捷性提供了新途径。

**Title (ZH)**: ViVa-SAFELAND：一种新的基于免费软件的视觉导航安全验证工具用于 aerial 车辆 

**Authors**: Miguel S. Soriano-García, Diego A. Mercado-Ravell  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14719)  

**Abstract**: ViVa-SAFELAND is an open source software library, aimed to test and evaluate vision-based navigation strategies for aerial vehicles, with special interest in autonomous landing, while complying with legal regulations and people's safety. It consists of a collection of high definition aerial videos, focusing on real unstructured urban scenarios, recording moving obstacles of interest, such as cars and people. Then, an Emulated Aerial Vehicle (EAV) with a virtual moving camera is implemented in order to ``navigate" inside the video, according to high-order commands. ViVa-SAFELAND provides a new, safe, simple and fair comparison baseline to evaluate and compare different visual navigation solutions under the same conditions, and to randomize variables along several trials. It also facilitates the development of autonomous landing and navigation strategies, as well as the generation of image datasets for different training tasks. Moreover, it is useful for training either human of autonomous pilots using deep learning. The effectiveness of the framework for validating vision algorithms is demonstrated through two case studies, detection of moving objects and risk assessment segmentation. To our knowledge, this is the first safe validation framework of its kind, to test and compare visual navigation solution for aerial vehicles, which is a crucial aspect for urban deployment in complex real scenarios.

# Model Predictive Path Integral Control of I2RIS Robot Using RBF Identifier and Extended Kalman Filter 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于RBF标识器和扩展卡尔曼滤波的I2RIS机器人路径积分预测控制 

**Authors**: Mojtaba Esfandiari, Pengyuan Du, Haochen Wei, Peter Gehlbach, Adnan Munawar, Peter Kazanzides, Iulian Iordachita  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14684)  

**Abstract**: Modeling and controlling cable-driven snake robots is a challenging problem due to nonlinear mechanical properties such as hysteresis, variable stiffness, and unknown friction between the actuation cables and the robot body. This challenge is more significant for snake robots in ophthalmic surgery applications, such as the Improved Integrated Robotic Intraocular Snake (I$^2$RIS), given its small size and lack of embedded sensory feedback. Data-driven models take advantage of global function approximations, reducing complicated analytical models' challenge and computational costs. However, their performance might deteriorate in case of new data unseen in the training phase. Therefore, adding an adaptation mechanism might improve these models' performance during snake robots' interactions with unknown environments. In this work, we applied a model predictive path integral (MPPI) controller on a data-driven model of the I$^2$RIS based on the Gaussian mixture model (GMM) and Gaussian mixture regression (GMR). To analyze the performance of the MPPI in unseen robot-tissue interaction situations, unknown external disturbances and environmental loads are simulated and added to the GMM-GMR model. These uncertainties of the robot model are then identified online using a radial basis function (RBF) whose weights are updated using an extended Kalman filter (EKF). Simulation results demonstrated the robustness of the optimal control solutions of the MPPI algorithm and its computational superiority over a conventional model predictive control (MPC) algorithm.

# Reinforcement Learning-Based Neuroadaptive Control of Robotic Manipulators under Deferred Constraints 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于强化学习的递推约束条件下机器人 manipulator 的自适应神经控制 

**Authors**: Hamed Rahimi Nohooji, Abolfazl Zaraki, Holger Voos  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14669)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based neuroadaptive control framework for robotic manipulators operating under deferred constraints. The proposed approach improves traditional barrier Lyapunov functions by introducing a smooth constraint enforcement mechanism that offers two key advantages: (i) it minimizes control effort in unconstrained regions and progressively increases it near constraints, improving energy efficiency, and (ii) it enables gradual constraint activation through a prescribed-time shifting function, allowing safe operation even when initial conditions violate constraints. To address system uncertainties and improve adaptability, an actor-critic reinforcement learning framework is employed. The critic network estimates the value function, while the actor network learns an optimal control policy in real time, enabling adaptive constraint handling without requiring explicit system modeling. Lyapunov-based stability analysis guarantees the boundedness of all closed-loop signals. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through numerical simulations.

# Safety-Critical and Distributed Nonlinear Predictive Controllers for Teams of Quadrupedal Robots 

**Title (ZH)**: 安全临界且分布式的四足机器人队列非线性预测控制器 

**Authors**: Basit Muhammad Imran, Jeeseop Kim, Taizoon Chunawala, Alexander Leonessa, Kaveh Akbari Hamed  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.14656)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a novel hierarchical, safety-critical control framework that integrates distributed nonlinear model predictive controllers (DNMPCs) with control barrier functions (CBFs) to enable cooperative locomotion of multi-agent quadrupedal robots in complex environments. While NMPC-based methods are widely adopted for enforcing safety constraints and navigating multi-robot systems (MRSs) through intricate environments, ensuring the safety of MRSs requires a formal definition grounded in the concept of invariant sets. CBFs, typically implemented via quadratic programs (QPs) at the planning layer, provide formal safety guarantees. However, their zero-control horizon limits their effectiveness for extended trajectory planning in inherently unstable, underactuated, and nonlinear legged robot models. Furthermore, the integration of CBFs into real-time NMPC for sophisticated MRSs, such as quadrupedal robot teams, remains underexplored. This paper develops computationally efficient, distributed NMPC algorithms that incorporate CBF-based collision safety guarantees within a consensus protocol, enabling longer planning horizons for safe cooperative locomotion under disturbances and rough terrain conditions. The optimal trajectories generated by the DNMPCs are tracked using full-order, nonlinear whole-body controllers at the low level. The proposed approach is validated through extensive numerical simulations with up to four Unitree A1 robots and hardware experiments involving two A1 robots subjected to external pushes, rough terrain, and uncertain obstacle information. Comparative analysis demonstrates that the proposed CBF-based DNMPCs achieve a 27.89% higher success rate than conventional NMPCs without CBF constraints.

# High-Order Control Barrier Functions: Insights and a Truncated Taylor-Based Formulation 

**Title (ZH)**: 高阶控制屏障函数：洞见与截断泰勒级数形式 

**Authors**: Jianye Xu, Bassam Alrifaee  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15014)  

**Abstract**: We examine the complexity of the standard High-Order Control Barrier Function (HOCBF) approach and propose a truncated Taylor-based approach that reduces design parameters. First, we derive the explicit inequality condition for the HOCBF approach and show that the corresponding equality condition sets a lower bound on the barrier function value that regulates its decay rate. Next, we present our Truncated Taylor CBF (TTCBF), which uses a truncated Taylor series to approximate the discrete-time CBF condition. While the standard HOCBF approach requires multiple class K functions, leading to more design parameters as the constraint's relative degree increases, our TTCBF approach requires only one. We support our theoretical findings in numerical collision-avoidance experiments and show that our approach ensures safety while reducing design complexity. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 我们分析了标准高阶控制障碍函数（HOCBF）方法的复杂性，并提出了一种裁剪的泰勒级数方法来减少设计参数。我们推导了HOCBF方法的显式不等式条件，并展示了相应等式条件为障碍函数值设置了下界，该下界调节其衰减速率。然后，我们提出了一种裁剪的泰勒级数控制障碍函数（TTCBF）方法，该方法通过裁剪的泰勒级数来近似离散时间控制障碍函数条件。标准HOCBF方法需要多个K类函数，随着约束的相对阶数增加导致设计参数更多，而我们的TTCBF方法只需一个。我们在数值碰撞避免实验中支持了理论发现，并展示了我们的方法在确保安全的同时减少了设计复杂性。
