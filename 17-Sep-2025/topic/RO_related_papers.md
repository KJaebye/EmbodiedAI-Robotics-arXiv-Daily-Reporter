**Abstract**: The endurance and energy efficiency of drones remain critical challenges in their design and operation. To extend mission duration, numerous studies explored perching mechanisms that enable drones to conserve energy by temporarily suspending flight. This paper presents a new perching drone that utilizes an active flexible perching mechanism inspired by the rapid predation mechanism of the Venus flytrap, achieving perching in less than 100 ms. The proposed system is designed for high-speed adaptability to the perching targets. The overall drone design is outlined, followed by the development and validation of the biomimetic perching structure. To enhance the system stability, a cascade extended high-gain observer (EHGO) based control method is developed, which can estimate and compensate for the external disturbance in real time. The experimental results demonstrate the adaptability of the perching structure and the superiority of the cascaded EHGO in resisting wind and perching disturbances.

# Hydrosoft: Non-Holonomic Hydroelastic Models for Compliant Tactile Manipulation 

**Title (ZH)**: Hydrosoft: 非全轭水弹性模型及其在柔顺触觉操作中的应用 

**Authors**: Miquel Oller, An Dang, Nima Fazeli  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13126)  

**Abstract**: Tactile sensors have long been valued for their perceptual capabilities, offering rich insights into the otherwise hidden interface between the robot and grasped objects. Yet their inherent compliance -- a key driver of force-rich interactions -- remains underexplored. The central challenge is to capture the complex, nonlinear dynamics introduced by these passive-compliant elements. Here, we present a computationally efficient non-holonomic hydroelastic model that accurately models path-dependent contact force distributions and dynamic surface area variations. Our insight is to extend the object's state space, explicitly incorporating the distributed forces generated by the compliant sensor. Our differentiable formulation not only accounts for path-dependent behavior but also enables gradient-based trajectory optimization, seamlessly integrating with high-resolution tactile feedback. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach across a range of simulated and real-world experiments and highlight the importance of modeling the path dependence of sensor dynamics. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 触觉传感器长期以来因其感知能力而备受重视，提供了对机器人与抓取物体之间隐藏界面的丰富见解。然而，其固有的顺应性——力丰富交互的关键驱动因素——仍然未被充分探索。核心挑战在于捕捉由这些被动顺应元件引入的复杂非线性动力学。在这里，我们提出了一种计算上高效的非完整水弹性模型，能够准确建模路径依赖的接触力分布和动态表面积变化。我们的见解在于扩展物体的状态空间，明确纳入由顺应传感器产生的分布力。可微分的建模不仅考虑了路径依赖行为，还允许基于梯度的轨迹优化，无缝结合高分辨率触觉反馈。我们在一系列模拟和实际实验中证明了该方法的有效性，并强调了建模传感器动力学路径依赖性的重要性。

# Model Predictive Control with Reference Learning for Soft Robotic Intracranial Pressure Waveform Modulation 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于参考学习的模型预测控制在颅内压波形调节中的应用 

**Authors**: Fabian Flürenbrock, Yanick Büchel, Johannes Köhler, Marianne Schmid Daners, Melanie N. Zeilinger  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13109)  

**Abstract**: This paper introduces a learning-based control framework for a soft robotic actuator system designed to modulate intracranial pressure (ICP) waveforms, which is essential for studying cerebrospinal fluid dynamics and pathological processes underlying neurological disorders. A two-layer framework is proposed to safely achieve a desired ICP waveform modulation. First, a model predictive controller (MPC) with a disturbance observer is used for offset-free tracking of the system's motor position reference trajectory under safety constraints. Second, to address the unknown nonlinear dependence of ICP on the motor position, we employ a Bayesian optimization (BO) algorithm used for online learning of a motor position reference trajectory that yields the desired ICP modulation. The framework is experimentally validated using a test bench with a brain phantom that replicates realistic ICP dynamics in vitro. Compared to a previously employed proportional-integral-derivative controller, the MPC reduces mean and maximum motor position reference tracking errors by 83 % and 73 %, respectively. In less than 20 iterations, the BO algorithm learns a motor position reference trajectory that yields an ICP waveform with the desired mean and amplitude.

# Beyond Anthropomorphism: Enhancing Grasping and Eliminating a Degree of Freedom by Fusing the Abduction of Digits Four and Five 

**Title (ZH)**: 超越拟人化：通过融合第四指和第五指的 abduction 增强抓取并消除一个自由度 

**Authors**: Simon Fritsch, Liam Achenbach, Riccardo Bianco, Nicola Irmiger, Gawain Marti, Samuel Visca, Chenyu Yang, Davide Liconti, Barnabas Gavin Cangan, Robert Jomar Malate, Ronan J. Hinchet, Robert K. Katzschmann  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13074)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents the SABD hand, a 16-degree-of-freedom (DoF) robotic hand that departs from purely anthropomorphic designs to achieve an expanded grasp envelope, enable manipulation poses beyond human capability, and reduce the required number of actuators. This is achieved by combining the adduction/abduction (Add/Abd) joint of digits four and five into a single joint with a large range of motion. The combined joint increases the workspace of the digits by 400\% and reduces the required DoFs while retaining dexterity. Experimental results demonstrate that the combined Add/Abd joint enables the hand to grasp objects with a side distance of up to 200 mm. Reinforcement learning-based investigations show that the design enables grasping policies that are effective not only for handling larger objects but also for achieving enhanced grasp stability. In teleoperated trials, the hand successfully performed 86\% of attempted grasps on suitable YCB objects, including challenging non-anthropomorphic configurations. These findings validate the design's ability to enhance grasp stability, flexibility, and dexterous manipulation without added complexity, making it well-suited for a wide range of applications.

# Practical Handling of Dynamic Environments in Decentralised Multi-Robot Patrol 

**Title (ZH)**: 分散控制的多机器人巡逻中动态环境的实际处理 

**Authors**: James C. Ward, Arthur Richards, Edmund R. Hunt  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.13069)  

**Abstract**: Persistent monitoring using robot teams is of interest in fields such as security, environmental monitoring, and disaster recovery. Performing such monitoring in a fully on-line decentralised fashion has significant potential advantages for robustness, adaptability, and scalability of monitoring solutions, including, in principle, the capacity to effectively adapt in real-time to a changing environment. We examine this through the lens of multi-robot patrol, in which teams of patrol robots must persistently minimise time between visits to points of interest, within environments where traversability of routes is highly dynamic. These dynamics must be observed by patrol agents and accounted for in a fully decentralised on-line manner. In this work, we present a new method of monitoring and adjusting for environment dynamics in a decentralised multi-robot patrol team. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms realistic baselines in highly dynamic scenarios, and also investigate dynamic scenarios in which explicitly accounting for environment dynamics may be unnecessary or impractical.

# Spatiotemporal Calibration for Laser Vision Sensor in Hand-eye System Based on Straight-line Constraint 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于直线约束的手眼系统激光视觉传感器时空标定 

**Authors**: Peiwen Yang, Mingquan Jiang, Xinyue Shen, Heping Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12928)  

**Abstract**: Laser vision sensors (LVS) are critical perception modules for industrial robots, facilitating real-time acquisition of workpiece geometric data in welding applications. However, the camera communication delay will lead to a temporal desynchronization between captured images and the robot motions. Additionally, hand-eye extrinsic parameters may vary during prolonged measurement. To address these issues, we introduce a measurement model of LVS considering the effect of the camera's time-offset and propose a teaching-free spatiotemporal calibration method utilizing line constraints. This method involves a robot equipped with an LVS repeatedly scanning straight-line fillet welds using S-shaped trajectories. Regardless of the robot's orientation changes, all measured welding positions are constrained to a straight-line, represented by Plucker coordinates. Moreover, a nonlinear optimization model based on straight-line constraints is established. Subsequently, the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA) is employed to optimize parameters, including time-offset, hand-eye extrinsic parameters, and straight-line parameters. The feasibility and accuracy of the proposed approach are quantitatively validated through experiments on curved weld scanning. We open-sourced the code, dataset, and simulation report at this https URL.

**Title (ZH)**: 基于不确定性区间决策的移动障碍物导航 

**Authors**: Kai Zhang, Eric Lucet, Julien Alexandre Dit Sandretto, Shoubin Chen, David Filait  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12723)  

**Abstract**: Navigation among movable obstacles (NAMO) is a critical task in robotics, often challenged by real-world uncertainties such as observation noise, model approximations, action failures, and partial observability. Existing solutions frequently assume ideal conditions, leading to suboptimal or risky decisions. This paper introduces NAMOUnc, a novel framework designed to address these uncertainties by integrating them into the decision-making process. We first estimate them and compare the corresponding time cost intervals for removing and bypassing obstacles, optimizing both the success rate and time efficiency, ensuring safer and more efficient navigation. We validate our method through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, demonstrating significant improvements over existing NAMO frameworks.

# MoiréTac: A Dual-Mode Visuotactile Sensor for Multidimensional Perception Using Moiré Pattern Amplification 

**Title (ZH)**: MoiréTac: 一种基于莫尔图案放大效应的双模式视触觉传感器多维感知方法 

**Authors**: Kit-Wa Sou, Junhao Gong, Shoujie Li, Chuqiao Lyu, Ziwu Song, Shilong Mu, Wenbo Ding  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12714)  

**Abstract**: Visuotactile sensors typically employ sparse marker arrays that limit spatial resolution and lack clear analytical force-to-image relationships. To solve this problem, we present \textbf{MoiréTac}, a dual-mode sensor that generates dense interference patterns via overlapping micro-gratings within a transparent architecture. When two gratings overlap with misalignment, they create moiré patterns that amplify microscopic deformations. The design preserves optical clarity for vision tasks while producing continuous moiré fields for tactile sensing, enabling simultaneous 6-axis force/torque measurement, contact localization, and visual perception. We combine physics-based features (brightness, phase gradient, orientation, and period) from moiré patterns with deep spatial features. These are mapped to 6-axis force/torque measurements, enabling interpretable regression through end-to-end learning. Experimental results demonstrate three capabilities: force/torque measurement with R^2 > 0.98 across tested axes; sensitivity tuning through geometric parameters (threefold gain adjustment); and vision functionality for object classification despite moiré overlay. Finally, we integrate the sensor into a robotic arm for cap removal with coordinated force and torque control, validating its potential for dexterous manipulation.

# Safety filtering of robotic manipulation under environment uncertainty: a computational approach 

**Title (ZH)**: 机器人操作在环境不确定性下的安全过滤：一种计算方法 

**Authors**: Anna Johansson, Daniel Lindmark, Viktor Wiberg, Martin Servin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12674)  

**Abstract**: Robotic manipulation in dynamic and unstructured environments requires safety mechanisms that exploit what is known and what is uncertain about the world. Existing safety filters often assume full observability, limiting their applicability in real-world tasks. We propose a physics-based safety filtering scheme that leverages high-fidelity simulation to assess control policies under uncertainty in world parameters. The method combines dense rollout with nominal parameters and parallelizable sparse re-evaluation at critical state-transitions, quantified through generalized factors of safety for stable grasping and actuator limits, and targeted uncertainty reduction through probing actions. We demonstrate the approach in a simulated bimanual manipulation task with uncertain object mass and friction, showing that unsafe trajectories can be identified and filtered efficiently. Our results highlight physics-based sparse safety evaluation as a scalable strategy for safe robotic manipulation under uncertainty.

# Zero to Autonomy in Real-Time: Online Adaptation of Dynamics in Unstructured Environments 

**Title (ZH)**: 从零到自主：不结构化环境中的实时动力学在线调整 

**Authors**: William Ward, Sarah Etter, Jesse Quattrociocchi, Christian Ellis, Adam J. Thorpe, Ufuk Topcu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12516)  

**Abstract**: Autonomous robots must go from zero prior knowledge to safe control within seconds to operate in unstructured environments. Abrupt terrain changes, such as a sudden transition to ice, create dynamics shifts that can destabilize planners unless the model adapts in real-time. We present a method for online adaptation that combines function encoders with recursive least squares, treating the function encoder coefficients as latent states updated from streaming odometry. This yields constant-time coefficient estimation without gradient-based inner-loop updates, enabling adaptation from only a few seconds of data. We evaluate our approach on a Van der Pol system to highlight algorithmic behavior, in a Unity simulator for high-fidelity off-road navigation, and on a Clearpath Jackal robot, including on a challenging terrain at a local ice rink. Across these settings, our method improves model accuracy and downstream planning, reducing collisions compared to static and meta-learning baselines.

# Bio-inspired tail oscillation enables robot fast crawling on deformable granular terrains 

**Title (ZH)**: 受生物启发的尾部摆动使机器人能够快速爬行于可变形的颗粒地形上 

**Authors**: Shipeng Liu, Meghana Sagare, Shubham Patil, Feifei Qian  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12468)  

**Abstract**: Deformable substrates such as sand and mud present significant challenges for terrestrial robots due to complex robot-terrain interactions. Inspired by mudskippers, amphibious animals that naturally adjust their tail morphology and movement jointly to navigate such environments, we investigate how tail design and control can jointly enhance flipper-driven locomotion on granular media. Using a bio-inspired robot modeled after the mudskipper, we experimentally compared locomotion performance between idle and actively oscillating tail configurations. Tail oscillation increased robot speed by 67% and reduced body drag by 46%. Shear force measurements revealed that this improvement was enabled by tail oscillation fluidizing the substrate, thereby reducing resistance. Additionally, tail morphology strongly influenced the oscillation strategy: designs with larger horizontal surface areas leveraged the oscillation-reduced shear resistance more effectively by limiting insertion depth. Based on these findings, we present a design principle to inform tail action selection based on substrate strength and tail morphology. Our results offer new insights into tail design and control for improving robot locomotion on deformable substrates, with implications for agricultural robotics, search and rescue, and environmental exploration.

# Computing forward statics from tendon-length in flexible-joint hyper-redundant manipulators 

**Title (ZH)**: 从柔性关节超冗余 manipulator 的肌腱长度计算前向静态特性 

**Authors**: Weiting Feng, Kyle L. Walker, Yunjie Yang, Francesco Giorgio-Serchi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12444)  

**Abstract**: Hyper-redundant tendon-driven manipulators of- fer greater flexibility and compliance over traditional manipu- lators. A common way of controlling such manipulators relies on adjusting tendon lengths, which is an accessible control parameter. This approach works well when the kinematic configuration is representative of the real operational con- ditions. However, when dealing with manipulators of larger size subject to gravity, it becomes necessary to solve a static force problem, using tendon force as the input and employing a mapping from the configuration space to retrieve tendon length. Alternatively, measurements of the manipulator posture can be used to iteratively adjust tendon lengths to achieve a desired posture. Hence, either tension measurement or state estimation of the manipulator are required, both of which are not always accurately available. Here, we propose a solution by reconciling cables tension and length as the input for the solution of the system forward statics. We develop a screw-based formulation for a tendon-driven, multi-segment, hyper-redundant manipulator with elastic joints and introduce a forward statics iterative solution method that equivalently makes use of either tendon length or tension as the input. This strategy is experimentally validated using a traditional tension input first, subsequently showing the efficacy of the method when exclusively tendon lengths are used. The results confirm the possibility to perform open-loop control in static conditions using a kinematic input only, thus bypassing some of the practical problems with tension measurement and state estimation of hyper-redundant systems. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 超冗余缆驱动 manipulator 提供了比传统 manipulator 更大的灵活性和顺应性。控制这类 manipulator 的常见方法是调节缆绳长度，这是一种可访问的控制参数。当运动配置能代表实际操作条件时，这种方法效果很好。然而，处理受到重力影响的较大尺寸 manipulator 时，需要解决一个静态力问题，将缆绳力作为输入，并通过从配置空间映射来检索缆绳长度。此外，还可以通过迭代调整缆绳长度来利用 manipulator 的姿势测量来实现期望的姿势。因此，无论是张力测量还是 manipulator 的状态估计都是必要的，而这两者并不总是准确可用的。这里，我们提出一种解决方案，即通过将缆绳张力和长度作为解决系统静力学前向问题的输入来调和缆绳的张力和长度。我们为具有弹性关节的缆绳驱动多段超冗余 manipulator 开发了一种基于螺钉的公式，并提出了一种等效地将缆绳长度或张力作为输入的前向静力学迭代解决方案方法。该策略首先使用传统张力输入在实验中得到验证，并随后表明在仅使用缆绳长度时该方法的有效性。结果证实，在静态条件下仅使用运动输入即可实现开环控制的可能性，从而绕过了绷紧度测量和超冗余系统状态估计的一些实用问题。

# MinJointTracker: Real-time inertial kinematic chain tracking with joint position estimation and minimal state size 

**Title (ZH)**: MinJointTracker：基于关节位置估计和最小状态尺寸的实时惯性运动链跟踪 

**Authors**: Michael Lorenz, Bertram Taetz, Gabriele Bleser-Taetz, Didier Stricker  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12398)  

**Abstract**: Inertial motion capture is a promising approach for capturing motion outside the laboratory. However, as one major drawback, most of the current methods require different quantities to be calibrated or computed offline as part of the setup process, such as segment lengths, relative orientations between inertial measurement units (IMUs) and segment coordinate frames (IMU-to-segment calibrations) or the joint positions in the IMU frames. This renders the setup process inconvenient. This work contributes to real-time capable calibration-free inertial tracking of a kinematic chain, i.e. simultaneous recursive Bayesian estimation of global IMU angular kinematics and joint positions in the IMU frames, with a minimal state size. Experimental results on simulated IMU data from a three-link kinematic chain (manipulator study) as well as re-simulated IMU data from healthy humans walking (lower body study) show that the calibration-free and lightweight algorithm provides not only drift-free relative but also drift-free absolute orientation estimates with a global heading reference for only one IMU as well as robust and fast convergence of joint position estimates in the different movement scenarios.

# Distributed Event-Triggered Distance-Based Formation Control for Multi-Agent Systems 

**Title (ZH)**: 分布式基于事件触发的距离导向多agent系统结构控制 

**Authors**: Evangelos Psomiadis, Panagiotis Tsiotras  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12390)  

**Abstract**: This paper addresses the problem of collaborative formation control for multi-agent systems with limited resources. We consider a team of robots tasked with achieving a desired formation from arbitrary initial configurations. To reduce unnecessary control updates and conserve resources, we propose a distributed event-triggered formation controller that relies on inter-agent distance measurements. Control updates are triggered only when the measurement error exceeds a predefined threshold, ensuring system stability. The proposed controller is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments involving different formations, communication topologies, scalability tests, and variations in design parameters, while also being compared against periodic triggering strategies. Results demonstrate that the event-triggered approach significantly reduces control efforts while preserving formation performance.

# Geometric Red-Teaming for Robotic Manipulation 

**Title (ZH)**: 几何红队演练在机器人操作中的应用 

**Authors**: Divyam Goel, Yufei Wang, Tiancheng Wu, Guixiu Qiao, Pavel Piliptchak, David Held, Zackory Erickson  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12379)  

**Abstract**: Standard evaluation protocols in robotic manipulation typically assess policy performance over curated, in-distribution test sets, offering limited insight into how systems fail under plausible variation. We introduce Geometric Red-Teaming (GRT), a red-teaming framework that probes robustness through object-centric geometric perturbations, automatically generating CrashShapes -- structurally valid, user-constrained mesh deformations that trigger catastrophic failures in pre-trained manipulation policies. The method integrates a Jacobian field-based deformation model with a gradient-free, simulator-in-the-loop optimization strategy. Across insertion, articulation, and grasping tasks, GRT consistently discovers deformations that collapse policy performance, revealing brittle failure modes missed by static benchmarks. By combining task-level policy rollouts with constraint-aware shape exploration, we aim to build a general purpose framework for structured, object-centric robustness evaluation in robotic manipulation. We additionally show that fine-tuning on individual CrashShapes, a process we refer to as blue-teaming, improves task success by up to 60 percentage points on those shapes, while preserving performance on the original object, demonstrating the utility of red-teamed geometries for targeted policy refinement. Finally, we validate both red-teaming and blue-teaming results with a real robotic arm, observing that simulated CrashShapes reduce task success from 90% to as low as 22.5%, and that blue-teaming recovers performance to up to 90% on the corresponding real-world geometry -- closely matching simulation outcomes.

# Force-Modulated Visual Policy for Robot-Assisted Dressing with Arm Motions 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于力调节的视觉政策用于具有臂运动的机器人辅助穿衣 

**Authors**: Alexis Yihong Hao, Yufei Wang, Navin Sriram Ravie, Bharath Hegde, David Held, Zackory Erickson  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.12741)  

**Abstract**: Robot-assisted dressing has the potential to significantly improve the lives of individuals with mobility impairments. To ensure an effective and comfortable dressing experience, the robot must be able to handle challenging deformable garments, apply appropriate forces, and adapt to limb movements throughout the dressing process. Prior work often makes simplifying assumptions -- such as static human limbs during dressing -- which limits real-world applicability. In this work, we develop a robot-assisted dressing system capable of handling partial observations with visual occlusions, as well as robustly adapting to arm motions during the dressing process. Given a policy trained in simulation with partial observations, we propose a method to fine-tune it in the real world using a small amount of data and multi-modal feedback from vision and force sensing, to further improve the policy's adaptability to arm motions and enhance safety. We evaluate our method in simulation with simplified articulated human meshes and in a real world human study with 12 participants across 264 dressing trials. Our policy successfully dresses two long-sleeve everyday garments onto the participants while being adaptive to various kinds of arm motions, and greatly outperforms prior baselines in terms of task completion and user feedback.
