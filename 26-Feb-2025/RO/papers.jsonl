While existing platforms excel at tasks such as rigid body manipulation and soft body deformation, they struggle to simulate more complex soft body behaviors like cutting and suturing. A key challenge lies in modeling soft body fracture and splitting using the finite-element method (FEM), which is the predominant approach in current platforms. Additionally, the two-way suture needle/thread contact inside a soft body is further complicated when using FEM. In this work, we use the material point method (MPM) for such challenging simulations and propose new rigid geometries and soft-rigid contact methods specifically designed for them. We introduce CRESSim-MPM, a GPU-accelerated MPM library that integrates multiple MPM solvers and incorporates surgical geometries for cutting and suturing, serving as a specialized physics engine for surgical applications. It is further integrated into Unity, requiring minimal modifications to existing projects for soft body simulation. We demonstrate the simulator's capabilities in real-time simulation of cutting and suturing on soft tissue and provide an initial performance evaluation of different MPM solvers when simulating varying numbers of particles.", 'abstract_zh': '最近的研究集中在开发手术模拟平台，利用合成数据训练机器学习代理或模型以提供手术辅助。虽然现有的平台在刚体操作和软体变形等任务上表现出色，但在模拟切割和缝合等更复杂的软体行为方面存在局限。关键挑战在于使用有限元方法（FEM）建模软体的骨折和分裂。此外，使用FEM模拟软体内缝合针/线的双向接触更为复杂。在本项工作中，我们采用物质点方法（MPM）进行此类具有挑战性的模拟，并提出专门为这些任务设计的新刚性几何形状和软-刚性接触方法。我们介绍了CRESSim-MPM，这是一个GPU加速的MPM库，集成了多个MPM求解器并包含了切开和缝合的手术几何，作为专门针对手术应用的物理引擎。该库进一步集成到Unity中，仅需少量修改即可实现现有项目的软体模拟。我们展示了模拟器在软组织切割和缝合的实时模拟能力，并提供了不同MPM求解器在模拟不同粒子数量时的初步性能评估。', 'title_zh': 'CRESSim-MPM: 一种用于手术软组织模拟（包括切割和缝合）的物料点方法库'}

Achieving this task demands robotic behaviors that prioritize safety by minimizing disturbances to surrounding objects, an essential but highly challenging requirement due to restricted motion space, limited fields of view, and complex object dynamics. In this paper, we introduce FetchBot, a sim-to-real framework designed to enable zero-shot generalizable and safety-aware object fetching from cluttered shelves in real-world settings. To address data scarcity, we propose an efficient voxel-based method for generating diverse simulated cluttered shelf scenes at scale and train a dynamics-aware reinforcement learning (RL) policy to generate object fetching trajectories within these scenes. This RL policy, which leverages oracle information, is subsequently distilled into a vision-based policy for real-world deployment. Considering that sim-to-real discrepancies stem from texture variations mostly while from geometric dimensions rarely, we propose to adopt depth information estimated by full-fledged depth foundation models as the input for the vision-based policy to mitigate sim-to-real gap. To tackle the challenge of limited views, we design a novel architecture for learning multi-view representations, allowing for comprehensive encoding of cluttered shelf scenes. This enables FetchBot to effectively minimize collisions while fetching objects from varying positions and depths, ensuring robust and safety-aware operation.

Traditional planning methods excel at long-horizon tasks but rely on a predefined graph with fixed distance metrics. In contrast, safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) can learn complex behaviors without relying on manual heuristics but fails to solve long-horizon tasks, particularly in goal-conditioned and multi-agent scenarios.\nIn this paper, we introduce a novel method that integrates the strengths of both planning and safe RL. Our method leverages goal-conditioned RL and safe RL to learn a goal-conditioned policy for navigation while concurrently estimating cumulative distance and safety levels using learned value functions via an automated self-training algorithm. By constructing a graph with states from the replay buffer, our method prunes unsafe edges and generates a waypoint-based plan that the agent follows until reaching its goal, effectively balancing faster and safer routes over extended distances.\nUtilizing this unified high-level graph and a shared low-level goal-conditioned safe RL policy, we extend this approach to address the multi-agent safe navigation problem. In particular, we leverage Conflict-Based Search (CBS) to create waypoint-based plans for multiple agents allowing for their safe navigation over extended horizons. This integration enhances the scalability of goal-conditioned safe RL in multi-agent scenarios, enabling efficient coordination among agents.\nExtensive benchmarking against state-of-the-art baselines demonstrates the effectiveness of our method in achieving distance goals safely for multiple agents in complex and hazardous environments.

The global search approach is robust to nonsmooth behavior, albeit yielding reduced-order solutions, while the local search provides higher accuracy but can be unstable near nonsmooth regions.
