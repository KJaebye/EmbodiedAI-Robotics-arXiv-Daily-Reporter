# Rational Inverse Reasoning 

**Title (ZH)**: 合理逆向推理 

**Authors**: Ben Zandonati, Tomás Lozano-Pérez, Leslie Pack Kaelbling  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08983)  

**Abstract**: Humans can observe a single, imperfect demonstration and immediately generalize to very different problem settings. Robots, in contrast, often require hundreds of examples and still struggle to generalize beyond the training conditions. We argue that this limitation arises from the inability to recover the latent explanations that underpin intelligent behavior, and that these explanations can take the form of structured programs consisting of high-level goals, sub-task decomposition, and execution constraints. In this work, we introduce Rational Inverse Reasoning (RIR), a framework for inferring these latent programs through a hierarchical generative model of behavior. RIR frames few-shot imitation as Bayesian program induction: a vision-language model iteratively proposes structured symbolic task hypotheses, while a planner-in-the-loop inference scheme scores each by the likelihood of the observed demonstration under that hypothesis. This loop yields a posterior over concise, executable programs. We evaluate RIR on a suite of continuous manipulation tasks designed to test one-shot and few-shot generalization across variations in object pose, count, geometry, and layout. With as little as one demonstration, RIR infers the intended task structure and generalizes to novel settings, outperforming state-of-the-art vision-language model baselines. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 人类可以从单个不完美的示范中观察并立即泛化到非常不同的问题设置中。相比之下，机器人通常需要数百个示例，仍然难以在训练条件之外泛化。我们argue这一限制源于无法恢复支撑智能行为的潜在解释，这些解释可以表现为由高层目标、子任务分解和执行约束组成的结构化程序。在这项工作中，我们提出了理性逆向推理（RIR），这是一种通过行为的分层生成模型推断这些潜在程序的框架。RIR将少量示例的模仿视为贝叶斯程序归纳：一个视觉语言模型迭代地提出结构化符号任务假设，而一个带有规划器的推理方案根据该假设下观测示范的可能性对每个假设进行评分。这个循环生成了简洁且可执行的程序的后验概率分布。我们评估RIR在设计用于测试在一射和少量示例下的跨物体姿态、数量、几何形状和布局变化中的泛化能力的任务套件上。即使只有一個示范，RIR也能推断出任务结构并泛化到新的设置中，优于最先进的视觉语言模型基线。

# Robot can reduce superior's dominance in group discussions with human social hierarchy 

**Title (ZH)**: 机器人可以在包含人类社会等级结构的讨论中减少权威者的主导地位 yal。 

**Authors**: Kazuki Komura, Kumi Ozaki, Seiji Yamada  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08767)  

**Abstract**: This study investigated whether robotic agents that deal with social hierarchical relationships can reduce the dominance of superiors and equalize participation among participants in discussions with hierarchical structures. Thirty doctors and students having hierarchical relationship were gathered as participants, and an intervention experiment was conducted using a robot that can encourage participants to speak depending on social hierarchy. These were compared with strategies that intervened equally for all participants without considering hierarchy and with a no-action. The robots performed follow actions, showing backchanneling to speech, and encourage actions, prompting speech from members with less speaking time, on the basis of the hierarchical relationships among group members to equalize participation. The experimental results revealed that the robot's actions could potentially influence the speaking time among members, but it could not be conclusively stated that there were significant differences between the robot's action conditions. However, the results suggested that it might be possible to influence speaking time without decreasing the satisfaction of superiors. This indicates that in discussion scenarios where experienced superiors are likely to dominate, controlling the robot's backchanneling behavior could potentially suppress dominance and equalize participation among group members. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 本研究探讨了处理社会层级关系的机器人代理是否能减少上级的支配地位并在具有层级结构的讨论中平等化参与者发言权。三十名具有层级关系的医生和学生作为参与者，进行了一项干预实验，使用能够根据社会层级鼓励参与者发言的机器人。这些实验结果被与均等地干预所有参与者、不考虑层级结构的无干预策略进行了对比。机器人根据组内成员之间的层级关系执行跟随行为（如回应发言）和促发表言行为，旨在平等化参与。实验结果表明，机器人的行为可能会影响成员的发言时间，但不能明确断定机器人干预条件之间存在显著差异。然而，结果提示在经验上级可能主导讨论的情景中，控制机器人的回应对话行为可能有助于抑制支配行为并平等化参与。

# Towards Safe Imitation Learning via Potential Field-Guided Flow Matching 

**Title (ZH)**: 通过潜能场导向的流匹配实现安全的imitation学习 

**Authors**: Haoran Ding, Anqing Duan, Zezhou Sun, Leonel Rozo, Noémie Jaquier, Dezhen Song, Yoshihiko Nakamura  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08707)  

**Abstract**: Deep generative models, particularly diffusion and flow matching models, have recently shown remarkable potential in learning complex policies through imitation learning. However, the safety of generated motions remains overlooked, particularly in complex environments with inherent obstacles. In this work, we address this critical gap by proposing Potential Field-Guided Flow Matching Policy (PF2MP), a novel approach that simultaneously learns task policies and extracts obstacle-related information, represented as a potential field, from the same set of successful demonstrations. During inference, PF2MP modulates the flow matching vector field via the learned potential field, enabling safe motion generation. By leveraging these complementary fields, our approach achieves improved safety without compromising task success across diverse environments, such as navigation tasks and robotic manipulation scenarios. We evaluate PF2MP in both simulation and real-world settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in task space and joint space control. Experimental results demonstrate that PF2MP enhances safety, achieving a significant reduction of collisions compared to baseline policies. This work paves the way for safer motion generation in unstructured and obstaclerich environments.

**Title (ZH)**: 基于物理原理的校准数字孪生技术在 construction vehicles 中的应用开发 

**Authors**: Deniz Karanfil, Daniel Lindmark, Martin Servin, David Torick, Bahram Ravani  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08576)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents the development of a calibrated digital twin of a wheel loader. A calibrated digital twin integrates a construction vehicle with a high-fidelity digital model allowing for automated diagnostics and optimization of operations as well as pre-planning simulations enhancing automation capabilities. The high-fidelity digital model is a virtual twin of the physical wheel loader. It uses a physics-based multibody dynamic model of the wheel loader in the software AGX Dynamics. Interactions of the wheel loader's bucket while in use in construction can be simulated in the virtual model. Calibration makes this simulation of high-fidelity which can enhance realistic planning for automation of construction operations. In this work, a wheel loader was instrumented with several sensors used to calibrate the digital model. The calibrated digital twin was able to estimate the magnitude of the forces on the bucket base with high accuracy, providing a high-fidelity simulation.

# Decoupling Geometry from Optimization in 2D Irregular Cutting and Packing Problems: an Open-Source Collision Detection Engine 

**Title (ZH)**: 在二维不规则切割与排版问题中解耦几何与优化：一个开源碰撞检测引擎 

**Authors**: Jeroen Gardeyn, Tony Wauters, Greet Vanden Berghe  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08341)  

**Abstract**: Addressing irregular cutting and packing (C&P) optimization problems poses two distinct challenges: the geometric challenge of determining whether or not an item can be placed feasibly at a certain position, and the optimization challenge of finding a good solution according to some objective function. Until now, those tackling such problems have had to address both challenges simultaneously, requiring two distinct sets of expertise and a lot of research & development effort. One way to lower this barrier is to decouple the two challenges. In this paper we introduce a powerful collision detection engine (CDE) for 2D irregular C&P problems which assumes full responsibility for the geometric challenge. The CDE (i) allows users to focus with full confidence on their optimization challenge by abstracting geometry away and (ii) enables independent advances to propagate to all optimization algorithms built atop it. We present a set of core principles and design philosophies to model a general and adaptable CDE focused on maximizing performance, accuracy and robustness. These principles are accompanied by a concrete open-source implementation called $\texttt{jagua-rs}$. This paper together with its implementation serves as a catalyst for future advances in irregular C&P problems by providing a solid foundation which can either be used as it currently exists or be further improved upon. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 解决非规则切割与排样（C&P）优化问题面临着两个独特的挑战：几何挑战，即确定项目是否可以放置在某个位置，以及优化挑战，即根据某些目标函数找到一个好的解决方案。直到现在，解决这些问题的研究者不得不同时应对这两个挑战，这需要两种不同的专长和技术研发努力。一种降低这种障碍的方法是将这两个挑战分离。本文介绍了一种强大的二维非规则C&P问题碰撞检测引擎（CDE），该引擎完全负责解决几何挑战。CDE能够通过抽象掉几何问题，让用户全神贯注于优化挑战，同时允许独立的技术进步传递给所有基于它的优化算法。本文提出了一套核心原则和设计哲学，旨在构建一个通用且可适应的CDE，以最大化性能、准确性和稳健性。这些原则伴随着一个具体的开源实现，名为$\texttt{jagua-rs}$。本文与其实现共同作用，为未来非规则C&P问题的进步提供了一个坚实的基础，既可以现用也可进一步改进。

# CVCM Track Circuits Pre-emptive Failure Diagnostics for Predictive Maintenance Using Deep Neural Networks 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于深度神经网络的CVCM轨道电路预发失误诊技术及其预测性维护应用 

**Authors**: Debdeep Mukherjee, Eduardo Di Santi, Clément Lefebvre, Nenad Mijatovic, Victor Martin, Thierry Josse, Jonathan Brown, Kenza Saiah  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09054)  

**Abstract**: Track circuits are critical for railway operations, acting as the main signalling sub-system to locate trains. Continuous Variable Current Modulation (CVCM) is one such technology. Like any field-deployed, safety-critical asset, it can fail, triggering cascading disruptions. Many failures originate as subtle anomalies that evolve over time, often not visually apparent in monitored signals. Conventional approaches, which rely on clear signal changes, struggle to detect them early. Early identification of failure types is essential to improve maintenance planning, minimising downtime and revenue loss. Leveraging deep neural networks, we propose a predictive maintenance framework that classifies anomalies well before they escalate into failures. Validated on 10 CVCM failure cases across different installations, the method is ISO-17359 compliant and outperforms conventional techniques, achieving 99.31% overall accuracy with detection within 1% of anomaly onset. Through conformal prediction, we provide uncertainty estimates, reaching 99% confidence with consistent coverage across classes. Given CVCMs global deployment, the approach is scalable and adaptable to other track circuits and railway systems, enhancing operational reliability.

# A First Look at Predictability and Explainability of Pre-request Passenger Waiting Time in Ridesharing Systems 

**Title (ZH)**: 预请求乘车等待时间在拼车系统中的可预测性和可解释性初探 

**Authors**: Jie Wang, Guang Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09027)  

**Abstract**: Passenger waiting time prediction plays a critical role in enhancing both ridesharing user experience and platform efficiency. While most existing research focuses on post-request waiting time prediction with knowing the matched driver information, pre-request waiting time prediction (i.e., before submitting a ride request and without matching a driver) is also important, as it enables passengers to plan their trips more effectively and enhance the experience of both passengers and drivers. However, it has not been fully studied by existing works. In this paper, we take the first step toward understanding the predictability and explainability of pre-request passenger waiting time in ridesharing systems. Particularly, we conduct an in-depth data-driven study to investigate the impact of demand&supply dynamics on passenger waiting time. Based on this analysis and feature engineering, we propose FiXGBoost, a novel feature interaction-based XGBoost model designed to predict waiting time without knowing the assigned driver information. We further perform an importance analysis to quantify the contribution of each factor. Experiments on a large-scale real-world ridesharing dataset including over 30 million trip records show that our FiXGBoost can achieve a good performance for pre-request passenger waiting time prediction with high explainability.

# Silicon Minds versus Human Hearts: The Wisdom of Crowds Beats the Wisdom of AI in Emotion Recognition 

**Title (ZH)**: 硅心 versus 人心：群体的智慧在情绪识别中胜过人工智能的智慧 

**Authors**: Mustafa Akben, Vinayaka Gude, Haya Ajjan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08830)  

**Abstract**: The ability to discern subtle emotional cues is fundamental to human social intelligence. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes increasingly common, AI's ability to recognize and respond to human emotions is crucial for effective human-AI interactions. In particular, whether such systems can match or surpass human experts remains to be seen. However, the emotional intelligence of AI, particularly multimodal large language models (MLLMs), remains largely unexplored. This study evaluates the emotion recognition abilities of MLLMs using the Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test (RMET) and its multiracial counterpart (MRMET), and compares their performance against human participants. Results show that, on average, MLLMs outperform humans in accurately identifying emotions across both tests. This trend persists even when comparing performance across low, medium, and expert-level performing groups. Yet when we aggregate independent human decisions to simulate collective intelligence, human groups significantly surpass the performance of aggregated MLLM predictions, highlighting the wisdom of the crowd. Moreover, a collaborative approach (augmented intelligence) that combines human and MLLM predictions achieves greater accuracy than either humans or MLLMs alone. These results suggest that while MLLMs exhibit strong emotion recognition at the individual level, the collective intelligence of humans and the synergistic potential of human-AI collaboration offer the most promising path toward effective emotional AI. We discuss the implications of these findings for the development of emotionally intelligent AI systems and future research directions. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 具备识别微妙情感线索的能力是人类社会智能的基础。随着人工智能（AI）的日益普及，AI识别和响应人类情绪的能力对于有效的人机互作至关重要。特别是，这些系统能否匹配或超越人类专家尚待验证。然而，AI的情感智能，尤其是多模态大规模语言模型（MLLMs）的情感智能，尚未被充分探索。本研究通过使用面孔情感识别测试（RMET）及其多元种族对应版本（MRMET）评估MLLMs的情绪识别能力，并将其性能与人类参与者进行比较。结果显示，平均而言，在两项测试中，MLLMs在准确识别情绪方面优于人类。即使在低、中、高级别表现组之间进行比较时，这一趋势依然存在。然而，当我们将独立的人类决定汇总以模拟集体智慧时，人类群体的表现显著优于汇总的MLLM预测结果，突显了集体智慧的力量。此外，将人类和MLLM预测结合的协作方法（增强智能）比单独使用人类或MLLM都更准确。这些结果表明，虽然MLLMs在个体层面表现出强烈的情感识别能力，但人类集体智慧和人机协作的协同潜力为实现有效的情感AI提供了最光明的路径。我们讨论了这些发现对于开发情感智能AI系统的意义及其未来研究方向。

# GRainsaCK: a Comprehensive Software Library for Benchmarking Explanations of Link Prediction Tasks on Knowledge Graphs 

**Title (ZH)**: GRainsaCK：用于知识图上链接预测任务解释基准测试的综合软件库 

**Authors**: Roberto Barile, Claudia d'Amato, Nicola Fanizzi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08815)  

**Abstract**: Since Knowledge Graphs are often incomplete, link prediction methods are adopted for predicting missing facts. Scalable embedding based solutions are mostly adopted for this purpose, however, they lack comprehensibility, which may be crucial in several domains. Explanation methods tackle this issue by identifying supporting knowledge explaining the predicted facts. Regretfully, evaluating/comparing quantitatively the resulting explanations is challenging as there is no standard evaluation protocol and overall benchmarking resource. We fill this important gap by proposing GRainsaCK, a reusable software resource that fully streamlines all the tasks involved in benchmarking explanations, i.e., from model training to evaluation of explanations along the same evaluation protocol. Moreover, GRainsaCK furthers modularity/extensibility by implementing the main components as functions that can be easily replaced. Finally, fostering its reuse, we provide extensive documentation including a tutorial. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 由于知识图谱往往不完整，链接预测方法被用于预测缺失事实。虽然可扩展的嵌入解决方案被广泛采用，但它们缺乏可解释性，这在某些领域可能是至关重要的。解释方法通过识别支持预测事实的已有知识来解决这一问题。遗憾的是，定量评估和比较生成的解释具有挑战性，因为缺乏标准评估协议和综合基准资源。我们通过提出GRainsaCK，一种可重用的软件资源来填补这一重要空白，GRainsaCK全面 streamlined 整个解释基准测试任务，从模型训练到沿同一评估协议评估解释。此外，GRainsaCK 进一步实现了主要组件为可以轻松替换的函数，以增强其模块化和扩展性。最后，为了促进其重用，我们提供了详尽的文档，包括教程。

# Designing Memory-Augmented AR Agents for Spatiotemporal Reasoning in Personalized Task Assistance 

**Title (ZH)**: 设计基于记忆的AR代理以实现个性化任务协助中的空间时间推理 pestic化 

**Authors**: Dongwook Choi, Taeyoon Kwon, Dongil Yang, Hyojun Kim, Jinyoung Yeo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08774)  

**Abstract**: Augmented Reality (AR) systems are increasingly integrating foundation models, such as Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), to provide more context-aware and adaptive user experiences. This integration has led to the development of AR agents to support intelligent, goal-directed interactions in real-world environments. While current AR agents effectively support immediate tasks, they struggle with complex multi-step scenarios that require understanding and leveraging user's long-term experiences and preferences. This limitation stems from their inability to capture, retain, and reason over historical user interactions in spatiotemporal contexts. To address these challenges, we propose a conceptual framework for memory-augmented AR agents that can provide personalized task assistance by learning from and adapting to user-specific experiences over time. Our framework consists of four interconnected modules: (1) Perception Module for multimodal sensor processing, (2) Memory Module for persistent spatiotemporal experience storage, (3) Spatiotemporal Reasoning Module for synthesizing past and present contexts, and (4) Actuator Module for effective AR communication. We further present an implementation roadmap, a future evaluation strategy, a potential target application and use cases to demonstrate the practical applicability of our framework across diverse domains. We aim for this work to motivate future research toward developing more intelligent AR systems that can effectively bridge user's interaction history with adaptive, context-aware task assistance. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 增强现实(AR)系统 increasingly 越来越多地结合基础模型，如多模态大型语言模型(MLLMs)，以提供更具上下文意识和适应性的用户体验。这种结合导致了支持在现实世界环境中进行智能、目标导向交互的AR代理的发展。尽管当前的AR代理有效地支持即时任务，但在处理需要理解并充分利用用户长期经验和偏好的复杂多步场景方面存在困难。这种局限性源于他们无法在空间和时间上下文中捕捉、保留和推理用户的过往交互历史。为了解决这些挑战，我们提出了一种用于增强记忆的AR代理的构想框架，该框架可以通过在时间上学习和适应用户的特定体验来提供个性化的任务协助。我们的框架由四个相互连接的模块组成：(1) 多模态传感器处理感知模块，(2) 持久的空间和时间体验存储记忆模块，(3) 空间和时间推理模块，用于综合过去的和现在的上下文，以及(4) 执行模块，实现有效的AR通信。我们还提出了实现路线图、未来的评估策略、潜在的目标应用和用例，以展示我们框架在不同领域中的实用 applicability 实践适用性。我们希望这项工作能够激励未来的研究，发展更智能的AR系统，这些系统能够有效地将用户的交互历史与适应性强的、上下文感知的任务协助结合起来。

# Hybrid Node-Destroyer Model with Large Neighborhood Search for Solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于大规模邻域搜索的混合节点破坏模型用于解决带容量约束的车辆路径问题 

**Authors**: Bachtiar Herdianto, Romain Billot, Flavien Lucas, Marc Sevaux, Daniele Vigo  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08659)  

**Abstract**: In this research, we propose an iterative learning hybrid optimization solver developed to strengthen the performance of metaheuristic algorithms in solving the Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem (CVRP). The iterative hybrid mechanism integrates the proposed Node-Destroyer Model, a machine learning hybrid model that utilized Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) such identifies and selects customer nodes to guide the Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) operator within the metaheuristic optimization frameworks. This model leverages the structural properties of the problem and solution that can be represented as a graph, to guide strategic selections concerning node removal. The proposed approach reduces operational complexity and scales down the search space involved in the optimization process. The hybrid approach is applied specifically to the CVRP and does not require retraining across problem instances of different sizes. The proposed hybrid mechanism is able to improve the performance of baseline metaheuristic algorithms. Our approach not only enhances the solution quality for standard CVRP benchmarks but also proves scalability on very large-scale instances with up to 30,000 customer nodes. Experimental evaluations on benchmark datasets show that the proposed hybrid mechanism is capable of improving different baseline algorithms, achieving better quality of solutions under similar settings.

# P-CAFE: Personalized Cost-Aware Incremental Feature Selection For Electronic Health Records 

**Title (ZH)**: 个性化成本意识增量特征选择：电子健康记录中的P-CAFE 

**Authors**: Naama Kashani, Mira Cohen, Uri Shaham  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08646)  

**Abstract**: Electronic Health Records (EHR) have revolutionized healthcare by digitizing patient data, improving accessibility, and streamlining clinical workflows. However, extracting meaningful insights from these complex and multimodal datasets remains a significant challenge for researchers. Traditional feature selection methods often struggle with the inherent sparsity and heterogeneity of EHR data, especially when accounting for patient-specific variations and feature costs in clinical applications. To address these challenges, we propose a novel personalized, online and cost-aware feature selection framework tailored specifically for EHR datasets. The features are aquired in an online fashion for individual patients, incorporating budgetary constraints and feature variability costs. The framework is designed to effectively manage sparse and multimodal data, ensuring robust and scalable performance in diverse healthcare contexts. A primary application of our proposed method is to support physicians' decision making in patient screening scenarios. By guiding physicians toward incremental acquisition of the most informative features within budget constraints, our approach aims to increase diagnostic confidence while optimizing resource utilization. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 电子健康记录（EHR）通过数字化患者数据、提高可访问性并简化临床工作流程，革命性地改变了医疗保健。然而，从这些复杂且多模态的数据集中提取有意义的见解仍是研究人员面临的重大挑战。传统特征选择方法往往难以处理EHR数据固有的稀疏性和异质性，尤其是考虑患者特异性变异和特征成本时。为了应对这些挑战，我们提出了一种针对EHR数据集的新型个性化、在线和成本感知特征选择框架。特征以在线方式为每个患者获取，同时结合预算约束和特征变异成本。该框架旨在有效管理稀疏和多模态数据，在多种医疗保健情境中确保稳健且可扩展的性能。我们提出的该方法的主要应用是支持医生在患者筛查场景中的决策。通过在预算约束内引导医生逐步获取最信息丰富的特征，我们的方法旨在提高诊断信心并优化资源利用。

# Diminution: On Reducing the Size of Grounding ASP Programs 

**Title (ZH)**: 减小：关于减少地面ASP程序规模的方法 

**Authors**: HuanYu Yang, Fengming Zhu, YangFan Wu, Jianmin Ji  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08633)  

**Abstract**: Answer Set Programming (ASP) is often hindered by the grounding bottleneck: large Herbrand universes generate ground programs so large that solving becomes difficult. Many methods employ ad-hoc heuristics to improve grounding performance, motivating the need for a more formal and generalizable strategy. We introduce the notion of diminution, defined as a selected subset of the Herbrand universe used to generate a reduced ground program before solving. We give a formal definition of diminution, analyze its key properties, and study the complexity of identifying it. We use a specific encoding that enables off-the-shelf ASP solver to evaluate candidate subsets. Our approach integrates seamlessly with existing grounders via domain predicates. In extensive experiments on five benchmarks, applying diminutions selected by our strategy yields significant performance improvements, reducing grounding time by up to 70% on average and decreasing the size of grounding files by up to 85%. These results demonstrate that leveraging diminutions constitutes a robust and general-purpose approach for alleviating the grounding bottleneck in ASP.

**Abstract**: Partial differential equations (PDEs) form the mathematical foundation for modeling physical systems in science and engineering, where numerical solutions demand rigorous accuracy-efficiency tradeoffs. Mesh movement techniques address this challenge by dynamically relocating mesh nodes to rapidly-varying regions, enhancing both simulation accuracy and computational efficiency. However, traditional approaches suffer from high computational complexity and geometric inflexibility, limiting their applicability, and existing supervised learning-based approaches face challenges in zero-shot generalization across diverse PDEs and mesh this http URL this paper, we present an Unsupervised and Generalizable Mesh Movement Network (UGM2N). We first introduce unsupervised mesh adaptation through localized geometric feature learning, eliminating the dependency on pre-adapted meshes. We then develop a physics-constrained loss function, M-Uniform loss, that enforces mesh equidistribution at the nodal this http URL results demonstrate that the proposed network exhibits equation-agnostic generalization and geometric independence in efficient mesh adaptation. It demonstrates consistent superiority over existing methods, including robust performance across diverse PDEs and mesh geometries, scalability to multi-scale resolutions and guaranteed error reduction without mesh tangling.

**Title (ZH)**: POMO+：利用POMO中的起始节点解决容量约束车辆路径问题 

**Authors**: Szymon Jakubicz, Karol Kuźniak, Jan Wawszczak, Paweł Gora  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08493)  

**Abstract**: In recent years, reinforcement learning (RL) methods have emerged as a promising approach for solving combinatorial problems. Among RL-based models, POMO has demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks, including variants of the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP). However, there is room for improvement for these tasks. In this work, we improved POMO, creating a method (\textbf{POMO+}) that leverages the initial nodes to find a solution in a more informed way. We ran experiments on our new model and observed that our solution converges faster and achieves better results. We validated our models on the CVRPLIB dataset and noticed improvements in problem instances with up to 100 customers. We hope that our research in this project can lead to further advancements in the field.

# A Fast GRASP Metaheuristic for the Trigger Arc TSP with MIP-Based Construction and Multi-Neighborhood Local Search 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于MIP构建和多邻域局部搜索的快速GRASP元启发式算法用于触发弧TSP 

**Authors**: Joan Salvà Soler, Grégoire de Lambertye  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08477)  

**Abstract**: The Trigger Arc Traveling Salesman Problem (TA-TSP) extends the classical TSP by introducing dynamic arc costs that change when specific \textit{trigger} arcs are traversed, modeling scenarios such as warehouse operations with compactable storage systems. This paper introduces a GRASP-based metaheuristic that combines multiple construction heuristics with a multi-neighborhood local search. The construction phase uses mixed-integer programming (MIP) techniques to transform the TA-TSP into a sequence of tailored TSP instances, while the improvement phase applies 2-Opt, Swap, and Relocate operators. Computational experiments on MESS 2024 competition instances achieved average optimality gaps of 0.77\% and 0.40\% relative to the best-known solutions within a 60-second limit. On smaller, synthetically generated datasets, the method produced solutions 11.3\% better than the Gurobi solver under the same time constraints. The algorithm finished in the top three at MESS 2024, demonstrating its suitability for real-time routing applications with state-dependent travel costs. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 触发弧旅行商问题（TA-TSP）扩展了经典的TSP，通过引入当特定触发弧被遍历时会变化的动态弧成本，用于模拟具有可压缩存储系统的仓库操作场景。本文提出了一种基于GRASP的元启发式算法，该算法结合了多种构建启发式方法和多邻域局部搜索。构建阶段使用混合整数规划（MIP）技术将TA-TSP转化为一系列定制的TSP实例，改进阶段则应用了2-Opt、Swap和Relocate操作。在对MESF 2024竞赛实例的计算实验中，算法在60秒时间限制内相对于最优解平均取得了0.77%和0.40%的优化gap。在更小的合成生成数据集上，方法在相同的时间限制下，所得解比Gurobi求解器更好，提高了11.3%。该算法在MESF 2024竞赛中位列前三，展示了其适用于具有状态相关旅行成本的实时路由应用的适用性。

# Solver-Aided Expansion of Loops to Avoid Generate-and-Test 

**Title (ZH)**: Solver-Aided Expansion of Loops to Avoid Generate-and-Test 

**Authors**: Niklas Dewally, Özgür Akgün  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08442)  

**Abstract**: Constraint modelling languages like MiniZinc and Essence rely on unrolling loops (in the form of quantified expressions and comprehensions) during compilation. Standard approaches generate all combinations of induction variables and use partial evaluation to discard those that simplify to identity elements of associative-commutative operators (e.g. true for conjunction, 0 for summation). This can be inefficient for problems where most combinations are ultimately irrelevant. We present a method that avoids full enumeration by using a solver to compute only the combinations required to generate the final set of constraints. The resulting model is identical to that produced by conventional flattening, but compilation can be significantly faster. This improves the efficiency of translating high-level user models into solver-ready form, particularly when induction variables range over large domains with selective preconditions.

# Bilevel MCTS for Amortized O(1) Node Selection in Classical Planning 

**Title (ZH)**: bilevel MCTSfor 在经典规划中 amortized O(1) 节点选择中的应用 

**Authors**: Masataro Asai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08385)  

**Abstract**: We study an efficient implementation of Multi-Armed Bandit (MAB)-based Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) for classical planning. One weakness of MCTS is that it spends a significant time deciding which node to expand next. While selecting a node from an OPEN list with $N$ nodes has $O(1)$ runtime complexity with traditional array-based priority-queues for dense integer keys, the tree-based OPEN list used by MCTS requires $O(\log N)$, which roughly corresponds to the search depth $d$. In classical planning, $d$ is arbitrarily large (e.g., $2^k-1$ in $k$-disk Tower-of-Hanoi) and the runtime for node selection is significant, unlike in game tree search, where the cost is negligible compared to the node evaluation (rollouts) because $d$ is inherently limited by the game (e.g., $d\leq 361$ in Go). To improve this bottleneck, we propose a bilevel modification to MCTS that runs a best-first search from each selected leaf node with an expansion budget proportional to $d$, which achieves amortized $O(1)$ runtime for node selection, equivalent to the traditional queue-based OPEN list. In addition, we introduce Tree Collapsing, an enhancement that reduces action selection steps and further improves the performance.

# What Breaks Knowledge Graph based RAG? Empirical Insights into Reasoning under Incomplete Knowledge 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于知识图谱的 Retrieval-Augmented Generation 哪里出了问题？ incomplete 知识下推理的实证洞察 

**Authors**: Dongzhuoran Zhou, Yuqicheng Zhu, Xiaxia Wang, Hongkuan Zhou, Yuan He, Jiaoyan Chen, Evgeny Kharlamov, Steffen Staab  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08344)  

**Abstract**: Knowledge Graph-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is an increasingly explored approach for combining the reasoning capabilities of large language models with the structured evidence of knowledge graphs. However, current evaluation practices fall short: existing benchmarks often include questions that can be directly answered using existing triples in KG, making it unclear whether models perform reasoning or simply retrieve answers directly. Moreover, inconsistent evaluation metrics and lenient answer matching criteria further obscure meaningful comparisons. In this work, we introduce a general method for constructing benchmarks, together with an evaluation protocol, to systematically assess KG-RAG methods under knowledge incompleteness. Our empirical results show that current KG-RAG methods have limited reasoning ability under missing knowledge, often rely on internal memorization, and exhibit varying degrees of generalization depending on their design.

# An Efficient Application of Goal Programming to Tackle Multiobjective Problems with Recurring Fitness Landscapes 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于重复 Fitness 景观的多目标问题高效目标规划应用 

**Authors**: Rodrigo Lankaites Pinheiro, Dario Landa-Silva, Wasakorn Laesanklang, Ademir Aparecido Constantino  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08297)  

**Abstract**: Many real-world applications require decision-makers to assess the quality of solutions while considering multiple conflicting objectives. Obtaining good approximation sets for highly constrained many-objective problems is often a difficult task even for modern multiobjective algorithms. In some cases, multiple instances of the problem scenario present similarities in their fitness landscapes. That is, there are recurring features in the fitness landscapes when searching for solutions to different problem instances. We propose a methodology to exploit this characteristic by solving one instance of a given problem scenario using computationally expensive multiobjective algorithms to obtain a good approximation set and then using Goal Programming with efficient single-objective algorithms to solve other instances of the same problem scenario. We use three goal-based objective functions and show that on benchmark instances of the multiobjective vehicle routing problem with time windows, the methodology is able to produce good results in short computation time. The methodology allows to combine the effectiveness of state-of-the-art multiobjective algorithms with the efficiency of goal programming to find good compromise solutions in problem scenarios where instances have similar fitness landscapes. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 许多实际应用要求决策者在考虑多个互斥目标的情况下评估解决方案的质量。对于高度约束的多目标问题，获得良好的近似解集往往是现代多目标算法的一项艰巨任务。在某些情况下，不同问题实例的场景可能存在相似的适应度景观。也就是说，当为不同的问题实例寻找解决方案时，适应度景观中会呈现出重复特征。我们提出了一种方法来利用这一特点，通过使用计算昂贵的多目标算法解决给定问题场景的一个实例以获得良好的近似解集，然后使用高效的单目标算法结合目标规划方法解决相同问题场景的其他实例。我们使用三个基于目标的目标函数，并在多目标车辆 routing 问题（带时间窗口）的基准实例上展示了该方法能够在较短的计算时间内产生良好结果。该方法允许将先进的多目标算法的有效性与目标规划的效率相结合，在具有相似适应度景观的问题场景中找到良好的折衷解。

# Topos Causal Models 

**Title (ZH)**: 拓扑因果模型 

**Authors**: Sridhar Mahadevan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08295)  

**Abstract**: We propose topos causal models (TCMs), a novel class of causal models that exploit the key properties of a topos category: they are (co)complete, meaning all (co)limits exist, they admit a subobject classifier, and allow exponential objects. The main goal of this paper is to show that these properties are central to many applications in causal inference. For example, subobject classifiers allow a categorical formulation of causal intervention, which creates sub-models. Limits and colimits allow causal diagrams of arbitrary complexity to be ``solved", using a novel interpretation of causal approximation. Exponential objects enable reasoning about equivalence classes of operations on causal models, such as covered edge reversal and causal homotopy. Analogous to structural causal models (SCMs), TCMs are defined by a collection of functions, each defining a ``local autonomous" causal mechanism that assemble to induce a unique global function from exogenous to endogenous variables. Since the category of TCMs is (co)complete, which we prove in this paper, every causal diagram has a ``solution" in the form of a (co)limit: this implies that any arbitrary causal model can be ``approximated" by some global function with respect to the morphisms going into or out of the diagram. Natural transformations are crucial in measuring the quality of approximation. In addition, we show that causal interventions are modeled by subobject classifiers: any sub-model is defined by a monic arrow into its parent model. Exponential objects permit reasoning about entire classes of causal equivalences and interventions. Finally, as TCMs form a topos, they admit an internal logic defined as a Mitchell-Benabou language with an associated Kripke-Joyal semantics. We show how to reason about causal models in TCMs using this internal logic.

# Towards Universal Neural Inference 

**Title (ZH)**: 面向通用神经推理 

**Authors**: Shreyas Bhat Brahmavar, Yang Li, Junier Oliva  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09100)  

**Abstract**: Real-world data often appears in diverse, disjoint forms -- with varying schemas, inconsistent semantics, and no fixed feature ordering -- making it challenging to build general-purpose models that can leverage information across datasets. We introduce ASPIRE, Arbitrary Set-based Permutation-Invariant Reasoning Engine, a Universal Neural Inference model for semantic reasoning and prediction over heterogeneous structured data. ASPIRE combines a permutation-invariant, set-based Transformer with a semantic grounding module that incorporates natural language descriptions, dataset metadata, and in-context examples to learn cross-dataset feature dependencies. This architecture allows ASPIRE to ingest arbitrary sets of feature--value pairs and support examples, align semantics across disjoint tables, and make predictions for any specified target. Once trained, ASPIRE generalizes to new inference tasks without additional tuning. In addition to delivering strong results across diverse benchmarks, ASPIRE naturally supports cost-aware active feature acquisition in an open-world setting, selecting informative features under test-time budget constraints for an arbitrary unseen dataset. These capabilities position ASPIRE as a step toward truly universal, semantics-aware inference over structured data.

# SPARC: Soft Probabilistic Adaptive multi-interest Retrieval Model via Codebooks for recommender system 

**Title (ZH)**: SPARC: 基于编码本的软概率自适应多元兴趣检索模型 

**Authors**: Jialiang Shi, Yaguang Dou, Tian Qi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09090)  

**Abstract**: Modeling multi-interests has arisen as a core problem in real-world RS. Current multi-interest retrieval methods pose three major challenges: 1) Interests, typically extracted from predefined external knowledge, are invariant. Failed to dynamically evolve with users' real-time consumption preferences. 2) Online inference typically employs an over-exploited strategy, mainly matching users' existing interests, lacking proactive exploration and discovery of novel and long-tail interests. To address these challenges, we propose a novel retrieval framework named SPARC(Soft Probabilistic Adaptive Retrieval Model via Codebooks). Our contribution is two folds. First, the framework utilizes Residual Quantized Variational Autoencoder (RQ-VAE) to construct a discretized interest space. It achieves joint training of the RQ-VAE with the industrial large scale recommendation model, mining behavior-aware interests that can perceive user feedback and evolve dynamically. Secondly, a probabilistic interest module that predicts the probability distribution over the entire dynamic and discrete interest space. This facilitates an efficient "soft-search" strategy during online inference, revolutionizing the retrieval paradigm from "passive matching" to "proactive exploration" and thereby effectively promoting interest discovery. Online A/B tests on an industrial platform with tens of millions daily active users, have achieved substantial gains in business metrics: +0.9% increase in user view duration, +0.4% increase in user page views (PV), and a +22.7% improvement in PV500(new content reaching 500 PVs in 24 hours). Offline evaluations are conducted on open-source Amazon Product datasets. Metrics, such as Recall@K and Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain@K(NDCG@K), also showed consistent improvement. Both online and offline experiments validate the efficacy and practical value of the proposed method.

# E3-Rewrite: Learning to Rewrite SQL for Executability, Equivalence,and Efficiency 

**Title (ZH)**: E3-重写：学习为可执行性、等价性和效率重写SQL 

**Authors**: Dongjie Xu, Yue Cui, Weijie Shi, Qingzhi Ma, Hanghui Guo, Jiaming Li, Yao Zhao, Ruiyuan Zhang, Shimin Di, Jia Zhu, Kai Zheng, Jiajie Xu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09023)  

**Abstract**: SQL query rewriting aims to reformulate a query into a more efficient form while preserving equivalence. Most existing methods rely on predefined rewrite rules. However, such rule-based approaches face fundamental limitations: (1) fixed rule sets generalize poorly to novel query patterns and struggle with complex queries; (2) a wide range of effective rewriting strategies cannot be fully captured by declarative rules. To overcome these issues, we propose using large language models (LLMs) to generate rewrites. LLMs can capture complex strategies, such as evaluation reordering and CTE rewriting. Despite this potential, directly applying LLMs often results in suboptimal or non-equivalent rewrites due to a lack of execution awareness and semantic grounding. To address these challenges, We present E3-Rewrite, an LLM-based SQL rewriting framework that produces executable, equivalent, and efficient queries. It integrates two core components: a context construction module and a reinforcement learning framework. First, the context module leverages execution plans and retrieved demonstrations to build bottleneck-aware prompts that guide inference-time rewriting. Second, we design a reward function targeting executability, equivalence, and efficiency, evaluated via syntax checks, equivalence verification, and cost estimation. Third, to ensure stable multi-objective learning, we adopt a staged curriculum that first emphasizes executability and equivalence, then gradually incorporates efficiency. Extensive experiments show that E3-Rewrite achieves up to a 25.6\% reduction in query execution time compared to state-of-the-art methods across multiple SQL benchmarks. Moreover, it delivers up to 24.4\% more successful rewrites, expanding coverage to complex queries that previous systems failed to handle.

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.09012)  

**Abstract**: This paper describes our participation in SemEval 2025 Task 8, focused on Tabular Question Answering. We developed a zero-shot pipeline that leverages an Large Language Model to generate functional code capable of extracting the relevant information from tabular data based on an input question. Our approach consists of a modular pipeline where the main code generator module is supported by additional components that identify the most relevant columns and analyze their data types to improve extraction accuracy. In the event that the generated code fails, an iterative refinement process is triggered, incorporating the error feedback into a new generation prompt to enhance robustness. Our results show that zero-shot code generation is a valid approach for Tabular QA, achieving rank 33 of 53 in the test phase despite the lack of task-specific fine-tuning.

# Urban-STA4CLC: Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于城市理论的时空注意力模型：灾后商业用地利用变化预测（Urban-STA4CLC） 

**Authors**: Ziyi Guo, Yan Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08976)  

**Abstract**: Natural disasters such as hurricanes and wildfires increasingly introduce unusual disturbance on economic activities, which are especially likely to reshape commercial land use pattern given their sensitive to customer visitation. However, current modeling approaches are limited in capturing such complex interplay between human activities and commercial land use change under and following disturbances. Such interactions have been more effectively captured in current resilient urban planning theories. This study designs and calibrates a Urban Theory-Informed Spatio-Temporal Attention Model for Predicting Post-Disaster Commercial Land Use Change (Urban-STA4CLC) to predict both the yearly decline and expansion of commercial land use at census block level under cumulative impact of disasters on human activities over two years. Guided by urban theories, Urban-STA4CLC integrates both spatial and temporal attention mechanisms with three theory-informed modules. Resilience theory guides a disaster-aware temporal attention module that captures visitation dynamics. Spatial economic theory informs a multi-relational spatial attention module for inter-block representation. Diffusion theory contributes a regularization term that constrains land use transitions. The model performs significantly better than non-theoretical baselines in predicting commercial land use change under the scenario of recurrent hurricanes, with around 19% improvement in F1 score (0.8763). The effectiveness of the theory-guided modules was further validated through ablation studies. The research demonstrates that embedding urban theory into commercial land use modeling models may substantially enhance the capacity to capture its gains and losses. These advances in commercial land use modeling contribute to land use research that accounts for cumulative impacts of recurrent disasters and shifts in economic activity patterns.

# Revealing the Role of Audio Channels in ASR Performance Degradation 

**Title (ZH)**: 揭示音频通道在ASR性能下降中的作用 

**Authors**: Kuan-Tang Huang, Li-Wei Chen, Hung-Shin Lee, Berlin Chen, Hsin-Min Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08967)  

**Abstract**: Pre-trained automatic speech recognition (ASR) models have demonstrated strong performance on a variety of tasks. However, their performance can degrade substantially when the input audio comes from different recording channels. While previous studies have demonstrated this phenomenon, it is often attributed to the mismatch between training and testing corpora. This study argues that variations in speech characteristics caused by different recording channels can fundamentally harm ASR performance. To address this limitation, we propose a normalization technique designed to mitigate the impact of channel variation by aligning internal feature representations in the ASR model with those derived from a clean reference channel. This approach significantly improves ASR performance on previously unseen channels and languages, highlighting its ability to generalize across channel and language differences. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 预训练自动语音识别（ASR）模型在多种任务上展示了强大的性能，但当输入音频来自不同录音通道时，其性能会显著下降。尽管先前的研究已经展示了这一现象，但通常将其归因于训练和测试数据集之间的不匹配。本研究认为，不同录音通道引起的语音特征变化从根本上损害了ASR性能。为解决这一局限，我们提出了一种规范化技术，通过将ASR模型的内部特征表示与干净参考通道提取的特征对齐，以减轻通道变化的影响。该方法显著提高了ASR在未见过的通道和语言上的性能，突显了其在通道和语言差异上的泛化能力。

# QAMRO: Quality-aware Adaptive Margin Ranking Optimization for Human-aligned Assessment of Audio Generation Systems 

**Title (ZH)**: QAMRO：质量感知自适应边界排名优化方法及其在音频生成系统的人性化评估中的应用 

**Authors**: Chien-Chun Wang, Kuan-Tang Huang, Cheng-Yeh Yang, Hung-Shin Lee, Hsin-Min Wang, Berlin Chen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08957)  

**Abstract**: Evaluating audio generation systems, including text-to-music (TTM), text-to-speech (TTS), and text-to-audio (TTA), remains challenging due to the subjective and multi-dimensional nature of human perception. Existing methods treat mean opinion score (MOS) prediction as a regression problem, but standard regression losses overlook the relativity of perceptual judgments. To address this limitation, we introduce QAMRO, a novel Quality-aware Adaptive Margin Ranking Optimization framework that seamlessly integrates regression objectives from different perspectives, aiming to highlight perceptual differences and prioritize accurate ratings. Our framework leverages pre-trained audio-text models such as CLAP and Audiobox-Aesthetics, and is trained exclusively on the official AudioMOS Challenge 2025 dataset. It demonstrates superior alignment with human evaluations across all dimensions, significantly outperforming robust baseline models. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 评估文本到音乐(TTM)、文本到语音(TTS)和文本到音频(TTA)等音频生成系统仍然具有挑战性，这是因为人类感知的主观性和多维性。现有方法将主观意见得分(MOS)预测视为回归问题，但标准的回归损失忽略了感知判断的相对性。为解决这一局限，我们提出了一种名为QAMRO的新颖框架（Quality-aware Adaptive Margin Ranking Optimization），该框架能够从不同角度无缝集成回归目标，旨在突出感知差异并优先进行准确评分。该框架利用预训练的音频-文本模型如CLAP和Audiobox-Aesthetics，并仅在官方AudioMOS挑战2025数据集上进行训练。它在所有维度上与人类评估表现出更良好的对齐，并显著优于鲁棒基线模型。

# Generalising Traffic Forecasting to Regions without Traffic Observations 

**Title (ZH)**: 扩展交通预测到无交通观测区域 

**Authors**: Xinyu Su, Majid Sarvi, Feng Liu, Egemen Tanin, Jianzhong Qi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08947)  

**Abstract**: Traffic forecasting is essential for intelligent transportation systems. Accurate forecasting relies on continuous observations collected by traffic sensors. However, due to high deployment and maintenance costs, not all regions are equipped with such sensors. This paper aims to forecast for regions without traffic sensors, where the lack of historical traffic observations challenges the generalisability of existing models. We propose a model named GenCast, the core idea of which is to exploit external knowledge to compensate for the missing observations and to enhance generalisation. We integrate physics-informed neural networks into GenCast, enabling physical principles to regularise the learning process. We introduce an external signal learning module to explore correlations between traffic states and external signals such as weather conditions, further improving model generalisability. Additionally, we design a spatial grouping module to filter localised features that hinder model generalisability. Extensive experiments show that GenCast consistently reduces forecasting errors on multiple real-world datasets. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 交通流预测对于智能交通系统至关重要。准确的预测依赖于由交通传感器持续收集的数据观测。然而，由于部署和维护成本高昂，并非所有地区都配备了这类传感器。本文旨在预测未安装交通传感器地区的交通流，其中缺乏历史交通观测数据挑战了现有模型的一般适用性。我们提出了一种名为GenCast的模型，其核心思想是利用外部知识来弥补缺失的观测数据，并提高模型的一般适用性。我们将物理知情神经网络集成到GenCast中，使物理原理能够规范学习过程。我们引入了外部信号学习模块，以探索交通状态与外部信号（如天气条件）之间的关联，进一步提高模型的一般适用性。此外，我们设计了一个空间分组模块，以过滤妨碍模型一般适用性的局部特征。大量实验表明，GenCast在多个实际数据集上一致地减少了预测误差。

# EGGCodec: A Robust Neural Encodec Framework for EGG Reconstruction and F0 Extraction 

**Title (ZH)**: EGGCodec：一种适用于EGG重建和基频提取的鲁棒神经编解码框架 

**Authors**: Rui Feng, Yuang Chen, Yu Hu, Jun Du, Jiahong Yuan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08924)  

**Abstract**: This letter introduces EGGCodec, a robust neural Encodec framework engineered for electroglottography (EGG) signal reconstruction and F0 extraction. We propose a multi-scale frequency-domain loss function to capture the nuanced relationship between original and reconstructed EGG signals, complemented by a time-domain correlation loss to improve generalization and accuracy. Unlike conventional Encodec models that extract F0 directly from features, EGGCodec leverages reconstructed EGG signals, which more closely correspond to F0. By removing the conventional GAN discriminator, we streamline EGGCodec's training process without compromising efficiency, incurring only negligible performance degradation. Trained on a widely used EGG-inclusive dataset, extensive evaluations demonstrate that EGGCodec outperforms state-of-the-art F0 extraction schemes, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) from 14.14 Hz to 13.69 Hz, and improving voicing decision error (VDE) by 38.2\%. Moreover, extensive ablation experiments validate the contribution of each component of EGGCodec. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 这篇论文介绍了EGGCodec，一个针对电声门图（EGG）信号重建和基频提取的鲁棒神经编码框架。我们提出了一种多尺度频域损失函数来捕捉原始和重建EGG信号之间的微妙关系，并辅以时域相关损失以提高泛化能力和准确性。与传统的直接从特征中提取基频的Encodec模型不同，EGGCodec利用重建的EGG信号，这些信号更接近基频。通过移除传统的GAN判别器，我们在不牺牲效率的情况下简化了EGGCodec的训练过程，仅导致轻微的性能下降。在广泛使用的EGG包含数据集上训练后，广泛的研究表明，EGGCodec在基频提取方案中表现出色，将平均绝对误差（MAE）从14.14 Hz降低到13.69 Hz，并将发音决策错误（VDE）提高了38.2%。此外，广泛的消融实验验证了EGGCodec中每个组件的贡献。

**Title (ZH)**: Munsit 在 NADI 2025 共享任务 2：通过弱监督预训练和持续监督微调推动多方言阿拉伯语ASR的边界 

**Authors**: Mahmoud Salhab, Shameed Sait, Mohammad Abusheikh, Hasan Abusheikh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08912)  

**Abstract**: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a vital role in enabling natural human-machine interaction across applications such as virtual assistants, industrial automation, customer support, and real-time transcription. However, developing accurate ASR systems for low-resource languages like Arabic remains a significant challenge due to limited labeled data and the linguistic complexity introduced by diverse dialects. In this work, we present a scalable training pipeline that combines weakly supervised learning with supervised fine-tuning to develop a robust Arabic ASR model. In the first stage, we pretrain the model on 15,000 hours of weakly labeled speech covering both Modern Standard Arabic (MSA) and various Dialectal Arabic (DA) variants. In the subsequent stage, we perform continual supervised fine-tuning using a mixture of filtered weakly labeled data and a small, high-quality annotated dataset. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art results, ranking first in the multi-dialectal Arabic ASR challenge. These findings highlight the effectiveness of weak supervision paired with fine-tuning in overcoming data scarcity and delivering high-quality ASR for low-resource, dialect-rich languages. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 自动语音识别（ASR）在虚拟助手、工业自动化、客户服务和实时转录等多种应用中促进自然的人机交互方面发挥着关键作用。然而，由于标注数据有限且受多种方言的语言复杂性影响，开发准确的低资源语言如阿拉伯语的ASR系统仍然是一个重大挑战。在本工作中，我们提出了一种可扩展的训练管道，结合弱监督学习与监督微调，以开发稳健的阿拉伯语ASR模型。在第一个阶段，我们使用涵盖现代标准阿拉伯语（MSA）和各种方言阿拉伯语（DA）变体的15,000小时弱标注语音进行预训练。在后续阶段，我们使用过滤后的弱标注数据和一个小型高质量标注数据集进行持续的监督微调。我们的方法在多方言阿拉伯语ASR挑战中取得了领先成果。这些发现突显了弱监督与微调相结合在克服数据稀缺性并为低资源、方言丰富的语言提供高质量ASR方面的有效性。

# Position: Causal Machine Learning Requires Rigorous Synthetic Experiments for Broader Adoption 

**Title (ZH)**: 位置：因果机器学习需要严格的合成实验以实现更广泛的采纳。 

**Authors**: Audrey Poinsot, Panayiotis Panayiotou, Alessandro Leite, Nicolas Chesneau, Özgür Şimşek, Marc Schoenauer  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08883)  

**Abstract**: Causal machine learning has the potential to revolutionize decision-making by combining the predictive power of machine learning algorithms with the theory of causal inference. However, these methods remain underutilized by the broader machine learning community, in part because current empirical evaluations do not permit assessment of their reliability and robustness, undermining their practical utility. Specifically, one of the principal criticisms made by the community is the extensive use of synthetic experiments. We argue, on the contrary, that synthetic experiments are essential and necessary to precisely assess and understand the capabilities of causal machine learning methods. To substantiate our position, we critically review the current evaluation practices, spotlight their shortcomings, and propose a set of principles for conducting rigorous empirical analyses with synthetic data. Adopting the proposed principles will enable comprehensive evaluations that build trust in causal machine learning methods, driving their broader adoption and impactful real-world use. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 因果机器学习有潜力通过结合机器学习算法的预测能力和因果推断理论来革新决策。然而，这些方法在更广泛的机器学习社区中仍未得到充分利用，部分原因在于当前的经验性评估无法对其可靠性和稳健性进行评估，从而削弱了其实际应用价值。具体而言，社区中主要的批评之一是对合成实验的大量使用。我们反对这一观点，认为合成实验对于精确评估和理解因果机器学习方法的能力是必不可少且必要的。为了支持我们的观点，我们将批判性地回顾当前的评估实践，指出其不足之处，并提出一套使用合成数据进行严格经验分析的原则。采用提出的原则将能够进行全面的评估，增强对因果机器学习方法的信任，推动其更广泛的采纳和在现实世界中的广泛应用。

# Wavelet Mixture of Experts for Time Series Forecasting 

**Title (ZH)**: 小波专家混合模型的时间序列预测 

**Authors**: Zheng Zhou, Yu-Jie Xiong, Jia-Chen Zhang, Chun-Ming Xia, Xi-Jiong Xie  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08825)  

**Abstract**: The field of time series forecasting is rapidly advancing, with recent large-scale Transformers and lightweight Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models showing strong predictive performance. However, conventional Transformer models are often hindered by their large number of parameters and their limited ability to capture non-stationary features in data through smoothing. Similarly, MLP models struggle to manage multi-channel dependencies effectively. To address these limitations, we propose a novel, lightweight time series prediction model, WaveTS-B. This model combines wavelet transforms with MLP to capture both periodic and non-stationary characteristics of data in the wavelet domain. Building on this foundation, we propose a channel clustering strategy that incorporates a Mixture of Experts (MoE) framework, utilizing a gating mechanism and expert network to handle multi-channel dependencies efficiently. We propose WaveTS-M, an advanced model tailored for multi-channel time series prediction. Empirical evaluation across eight real-world time series datasets demonstrates that our WaveTS series models achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance with significantly fewer parameters. Notably, WaveTS-M shows substantial improvements on multi-channel datasets, highlighting its effectiveness. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 时间序列预测领域的研究正在迅速发展， Recent大规模Transformer模型和轻量级多层感知机(MLP)模型展现出强劲的预测性能。然而，传统的Transformer模型往往因参数量大且难以通过平滑捕捉数据中的非平稳特征而受到限制。同样，MLP模型在处理多通道依赖关系方面也表现不佳。为了解决这些问题，我们提出了一种新型轻量级时间序列预测模型WaveTS-B。该模型结合小波变换和MLP，以捕捉数据在小波域中的周期性和非平稳特征。在此基础上，我们提出了一种通道聚类策略，采用了专家集合（MoE）框架，利用门控机制和专家网络有效处理多通道依赖关系。我们还提出了WaveTS-M，一种专门针对多通道时间序列预测的高级模型。通过在八个真实世界的时间序列数据集上的实证评估表明，我们的WaveTS系列模型在显著减少参数数量的前提下，达到了最先进的性能。特别地，WaveTS-M在多通道数据集上表现出显著提升，突显了其有效性。

**Title (ZH)**: OISMA：针对矩阵乘法工作负载的实时内存随机乘法架构 

**Authors**: Shady Agwa, Yihan Pan, Georgios Papandroulidakis, Themis Prodromakis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08822)  

**Abstract**: Artificial Intelligence models are currently driven by a significant up-scaling of their complexity, with massive matrix multiplication workloads representing the major computational bottleneck. In-memory computing architectures are proposed to avoid the Von Neumann bottleneck. However, both digital/binary-based and analogue in-memory computing architectures suffer from various limitations, which significantly degrade the performance and energy efficiency gains. This work proposes OISMA, a novel in-memory computing architecture that utilizes the computational simplicity of a quasi-stochastic computing domain (Bent-Pyramid system), while keeping the same efficiency, scalability, and productivity of digital memories. OISMA converts normal memory read operations into in-situ stochastic multiplication operations with a negligible cost. An accumulation periphery then accumulates the output multiplication bitstreams, achieving the matrix multiplication functionality. Extensive matrix multiplication benchmarking was conducted to analyze the accuracy of the Bent-Pyramid system, using matrix dimensions ranging from 4x4 to 512x512. The accuracy results show a significant decrease in the average relative Frobenius error, from 9.42% (for 4x4) to 1.81% (for 512x512), compared to 64-bit double precision floating-point format. A 1T1R OISMA array of 4 KB capacity was implemented using a commercial 180nm technology node and in-house RRAM technology. At 50 MHz, OISMA achieves 0.891 TOPS/W and 3.98 GOPS/mm2 for energy and area efficiency, respectively, occupying an effective computing area of 0.804241 mm2. Scaling OISMA from 180nm to 22nm technology shows a significant improvement of two orders of magnitude in energy efficiency and one order of magnitude in area efficiency, compared to dense matrix multiplication in-memory computing architectures.

# TempOpt -- Unsupervised Alarm Relation Learning for Telecommunication Networks 

**Title (ZH)**: TempOpt -- 无监督电信网络报警关系学习 

**Authors**: Sathiyanaryanan Sampath, Pratyush Uppuluri, Thirumaran Ekambaram

**Abstract**: In a telecommunications network, fault alarms generated by network nodes are monitored in a Network Operations Centre (NOC) to ensure network availability and continuous network operations. The monitoring process comprises of tasks such as active alarms analysis, root alarm identification, and resolution of the underlying problem. Each network node potentially can generate alarms of different types, while nodes can be from multiple vendors, a network can have hundreds of nodes thus resulting in an enormous volume of alarms at any time. Since network nodes are inter-connected, a single fault in the network would trigger multiple sequences of alarms across a variety of nodes and from a monitoring point of view, it is a challenging task for a NOC engineer to be aware of relations between the various alarms, when trying to identify, for example, a root alarm on which an action needs to be taken. To effectively identify root alarms, it is essential to learn relation among the alarms for accurate and faster resolution. In this work we propose a novel unsupervised alarm relation learning technique Temporal Optimization (TempOpt) that is practical and overcomes the limitations of an existing class of alarm relational learning method-temporal dependency methods. Experiments have been carried on real-world network datasets, that demonstrate the improved quality of alarm relations learned by TempOpt as compared to temporal dependency method. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 电信网络中，网络操作中心(NOC)监测由网络节点生成的故障警报，以确保网络可用性和持续运行。监控过程包括活跃警报分析、根本性警报识别以及解决潜在问题。每个网络节点可能会生成不同类型的警报，而节点可能来自多个供应商，因此一个网络可能包含数百个节点，导致任何时间都有大量的警报。由于网络节点相互连接，网络中的单一故障可能会触发多个跨不同节点的警报序列。从监控角度看，NOC工程师要在尝试识别例如需要采取行动的根本性警报时，意识到各种警报之间的关系是一项挑战。为了有效识别根本性警报，了解警报之间的关系对于准确和快速解决问题至关重要。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种新的无监督警报关系学习技术时空优化（TempOpt），它实用且克服了现有警报关系学习方法——时间依赖方法的限制。实验已经在真实网络数据集上进行，结果显示TempOpt学习的警报关系质量优于时间依赖方法。

# Not in My Backyard! Temporal Voting Over Public Chores 

**Title (ZH)**: 不在我的后院！关于公共杂事的时间投票。 

**Authors**: Edith Elkind, Tzeh Yuan Neoh, Nicholas Teh  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08810)  

**Abstract**: We study a temporal voting model where voters have dynamic preferences over a set of public chores -- projects that benefit society, but impose individual costs on those affected by their implementation. We investigate the computational complexity of optimizing utilitarian and egalitarian welfare. Our results show that while optimizing the former is computationally straightforward, minimizing the latter is computationally intractable, even in very restricted cases. Nevertheless, we identify several settings where this problem can be solved efficiently, either exactly or by an approximation algorithm. We also examine the effects of enforcing temporal fairness and its impact on social welfare, and analyze the competitive ratio of online algorithms. We then explore the strategic behavior of agents, providing insights into potential malfeasance in such decision-making environments. Finally, we discuss a range of fairness measures and their suitability for our setting. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 我们研究一个关于公用事务的动态投票模型，其中选民在一系列有益社会但会给相关人员带来个人成本的项目上存在动态偏好。我们探讨了最大化功利主义和均等福利的计算复杂性。我们的结果表明，虽然最大化前者在计算上相对简单，但最小化后者在很多情况下都是计算上不可行的。尽管如此，我们仍然识别出一些可以高效求解此问题的情境，无论是精确求解还是通过近似算法。我们还研究了强制时间公平性对社会福利的影响，并分析了在线算法的竞争比。随后，我们探讨了代理的策略行为，并为这种决策环境下的潜在不当行为提供了见解。最后，我们讨论了几种公平性衡量标准及其在我们情境中的适用性。

# TechOps: Technical Documentation Templates for the AI Act 

**Title (ZH)**: TechOps: 技术文档模板for《人工智能法案》 

**Authors**: Laura Lucaj, Alex Loosley, Hakan Jonsson, Urs Gasser, Patrick van der Smagt  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08804)  

**Abstract**: Operationalizing the EU AI Act requires clear technical documentation to ensure AI systems are transparent, traceable, and accountable. Existing documentation templates for AI systems do not fully cover the entire AI lifecycle while meeting the technical documentation requirements of the AI Act.
This paper addresses those shortcomings by introducing open-source templates and examples for documenting data, models, and applications to provide sufficient documentation for certifying compliance with the AI Act. These templates track the system status over the entire AI lifecycle, ensuring traceability, reproducibility, and compliance with the AI Act. They also promote discoverability and collaboration, reduce risks, and align with best practices in AI documentation and governance.
The templates are evaluated and refined based on user feedback to enable insights into their usability and implementability. We then validate the approach on real-world scenarios, providing examples that further guide their implementation: the data template is followed to document a skin tones dataset created to support fairness evaluations of downstream computer vision models and human-centric applications; the model template is followed to document a neural network for segmenting human silhouettes in photos. The application template is tested on a system deployed for construction site safety using real-time video analytics and sensor data. Our results show that TechOps can serve as a practical tool to enable oversight for regulatory compliance and responsible AI development.

# ReQuestNet: A Foundational Learning model for Channel Estimation 

**Title (ZH)**: ReQuestNet：信道估计的础学习模型 

**Authors**: Kumar Pratik, Pouriya Sadeghi, Gabriele Cesa, Sanaz Barghi, Joseph B. Soriaga, Yuanning Yu, Supratik Bhattacharjee, Arash Behboodi  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08790)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we present a novel neural architecture for channel estimation (CE) in 5G and beyond, the Recurrent Equivariant UERS Estimation Network (ReQuestNet). It incorporates several practical considerations in wireless communication systems, such as ability to handle variable number of resource block (RB), dynamic number of transmit layers, physical resource block groups (PRGs) bundling size (BS), demodulation reference signal (DMRS) patterns with a single unified model, thereby, drastically simplifying the CE pipeline. Besides it addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for example, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by jointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown precoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet followed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive (Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet channel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded PRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel spatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet significantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a wide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB gain at high SNRs. Notably, ReQuestNet generalizes effectively to unseen channel profiles, efficiently exploiting inter-PRG and cross-MIMO correlations under dynamic PRG BS and varying transmit layer allocations.

**Authors**: Anaëlle Beignon, Thomas Thibault, Nolwenn Maudet  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08672)  

**Abstract**: Generative AI is being massively deployed in digital services, at a scale that will result in significant environmental harm. We document how tech companies are transforming established user interfaces to impose AI use and show how and to what extent these strategies fit within established deceptive pattern categories. We identify two main design strategies that are implemented to impose AI use in both personal and professional contexts: imposing AI features in interfaces at the expense of existing non-AI features and promoting narratives about AI that make it harder to resist using it. We discuss opportunities for regulating the imposed adoption of AI features, which would inevitably lead to negative environmental effects. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 生成式AI在数字服务中的大规模部署将导致显著的环境损害。我们记录了科技公司如何改造现有的用户界面以强制使用AI，并展示了这些策略如何以及在多大程度上符合已有的欺骗模式类别。我们确定了两种主要的设计策略，这些策略被用于在个人和专业场景中强制使用AI功能：以牺牲现有非AI功能为代价嵌入AI功能和推广关于AI的叙述，使其更难拒绝使用。我们探讨了监管强制采用AI功能的机会，这不可避免地会导致负面的环境影响。

# Hallucinations in Code Change to Natural Language Generation: Prevalence and Evaluation of Detection Metrics 

**Title (ZH)**: 代码更改到自然语言生成中的hallucinations：出现频率及检测指标的评估 

**Authors**: Chunhua Liu, Hong Yi Lin, Patanamon Thongtanunam  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08661)  

**Abstract**: Language models have shown strong capabilities across a wide range of tasks in software engineering, such as code generation, yet they suffer from hallucinations. While hallucinations have been studied independently in natural language and code generation, their occurrence in tasks involving code changes which have a structurally complex and context-dependent format of code remains largely unexplored. This paper presents the first comprehensive analysis of hallucinations in two critical tasks involving code change to natural language generation: commit message generation and code review comment generation. We quantify the prevalence of hallucinations in recent language models and explore a range of metric-based approaches to automatically detect them. Our findings reveal that approximately 50\% of generated code reviews and 20\% of generated commit messages contain hallucinations. Whilst commonly used metrics are weak detectors on their own, combining multiple metrics substantially improves performance. Notably, model confidence and feature attribution metrics effectively contribute to hallucination detection, showing promise for inference-time detection.\footnote{All code and data will be released upon acceptance. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 语言模型在软件工程的广泛任务中展现了强大的能力，如代码生成，但它们受到幻觉的困扰。虽然幻觉在自然语言和代码生成中已有独立研究，但在涉及代码更改的任务中，这类任务包含结构复杂且上下文依赖的代码格式，幻觉的发生情况仍鲜有探讨。本文首次对涉及代码更改到自然语言生成的两个关键任务中的幻觉进行了综合分析：提交信息生成和代码审查评论生成。我们量化了最近的语言模型中幻觉的发病率，并探索了一系列基于指标的方法以自动检测幻觉。我们的研究发现，约50%的生成代码审查评论和20%的生成提交信息包含幻觉。虽然常用的指标自身检测能力较弱，但多种指标的结合显著提高了检测性能。值得注意的是，模型置信度和特征归因指标有效贡献于幻觉检测，显示出在推理时间进行检测的潜力。

# Generative AI for Critical Infrastructure in Smart Grids: A Unified Framework for Synthetic Data Generation and Anomaly Detection 

**Title (ZH)**: 智能电网中关键基础设施的生成式AI：合成数据生成与异常检测的统一框架 

**Authors**: Aydin Zaboli, Junho Hong  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08593)  

**Abstract**: In digital substations, security events pose significant challenges to the sustained operation of power systems. To mitigate these challenges, the implementation of robust defense strategies is critically important. A thorough process of anomaly identification and detection in information and communication technology (ICT) frameworks is crucial to ensure secure and reliable communication and coordination between interconnected devices within digital substations. Hence, this paper addresses the critical cybersecurity challenges confronting IEC61850-based digital substations within modern smart grids, where the integration of advanced communication protocols, e.g., generic object-oriented substation event (GOOSE), has enhanced energy management and introduced significant vulnerabilities to cyberattacks. Focusing on the limitations of traditional anomaly detection systems (ADSs) in detecting threats, this research proposes a transformative approach by leveraging generative AI (GenAI) to develop robust ADSs. The primary contributions include the suggested advanced adversarial traffic mutation (AATM) technique to generate synthesized and balanced datasets for GOOSE messages, ensuring protocol compliance and enabling realistic zero-day attack pattern creation to address data scarcity. Then, the implementation of GenAI-based ADSs incorporating the task-oriented dialogue (ToD) processes has been explored for improved detection of attack patterns. Finally, a comparison of the GenAI-based ADS with machine learning (ML)-based ADSs has been implemented to showcase the outperformance of the GenAI-based frameworks considering the AATM-generated GOOSE datasets and standard/advanced performance evaluation metrics.

# AI Security Map: Holistic Organization of AI Security Technologies and Impacts on Stakeholders 

**Title (ZH)**: AI 安全图谱：人工智能安全技术的综合组织及其对利益相关者的影響 

**Authors**: Hiroya Kato, Kentaro Kita, Kento Hasegawa, Seira Hidano  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08583)  

**Abstract**: As the social implementation of AI has been steadily progressing, research and development related to AI security has also been increasing. However, existing studies have been limited to organizing related techniques, attacks, defenses, and risks in terms of specific domains or AI elements. Thus, it extremely difficult to understand the relationships among them and how negative impacts on stakeholders are brought about. In this paper, we argue that the knowledge, technologies, and social impacts related to AI security should be holistically organized to help understand relationships among them. To this end, we first develop an AI security map that holistically organizes interrelationships among elements related to AI security as well as negative impacts on information systems and stakeholders. This map consists of the two aspects, namely the information system aspect (ISA) and the external influence aspect (EIA). The elements that AI should fulfill within information systems are classified under the ISA. The EIA includes elements that affect stakeholders as a result of AI being attacked or misused. For each element, corresponding negative impacts are identified. By referring to the AI security map, one can understand the potential negative impacts, along with their causes and countermeasures. Additionally, our map helps clarify how the negative impacts on AI-based systems relate to those on stakeholders. We show some findings newly obtained by referring to our map. We also provide several recommendations and open problems to guide future AI security communities. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 随着人工智能的社会应用稳步进展，相关的AI安全研究和开发也在不断增加。然而，现有研究主要限于从特定领域或AI元素的角度组织相关技术、攻击、防御和风险。这使得理解它们之间的关系以及对利益相关者带来的负面影响变得极其困难。在这篇论文中，我们主张应该将与AI安全相关的知识、技术和社会影响整体组织起来，以帮助理解它们之间的关系。为此，我们首先开发了一张AI安全图谱，该图谱整体组织了与AI安全相关元素之间的关系以及对信息系统和利益相关者造成的负面影响。这张图谱包括两个方面，即信息系统方面（ISA）和外部影响方面（EIA）。在信息系统方面，AI需要满足的元素被分类。外部影响方面包括由于AI被攻击或误用而影响到的利益相关者元素。对于每个元素，都识别出了相应的负面影响。通过参考AI安全图谱，可以了解潜在的负面影响，及其原因和应对措施。此外，我们的图谱有助于澄清基于AI系统的负面影响与利益相关者之间的影响关系。我们展示了通过参考我们的图谱获得的一些新发现，并提供了几条建议和开放问题，以指导未来的AI安全社区。

# Who pays the RENT? Implications of Spatial Inequality for Prediction-Based Allocation Policies 

**Title (ZH)**: 谁支付RENT？空间不平等对基于预测的分配政策的影响 

**Authors**: Tasfia Mashiat, Patrick J. Fowler, Sanmay Das  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08573)  

**Abstract**: AI-powered scarce resource allocation policies rely on predictions to target either specific individuals (e.g., high-risk) or settings (e.g., neighborhoods). Recent research on individual-level targeting demonstrates conflicting results; some models show that targeting is not useful when inequality is high, while other work demonstrates potential benefits. To study and reconcile this apparent discrepancy, we develop a stylized framework based on the Mallows model to understand how the spatial distribution of inequality affects the effectiveness of door-to-door outreach policies. We introduce the RENT (Relative Efficiency of Non-Targeting) metric, which we use to assess the effectiveness of targeting approaches compared with neighborhood-based approaches in preventing tenant eviction when high-risk households are more versus less spatially concentrated. We then calibrate the model parameters to eviction court records collected in a medium-sized city in the USA. Results demonstrate considerable gains in the number of high-risk households canvassed through individually targeted policies, even in a highly segregated metro area with concentrated risks of eviction. We conclude that apparent discrepancies in the prior literature can be reconciled by considering 1) the source of deployment costs and 2) the observed versus modeled concentrations of risk. Our results inform the deployment of AI-based solutions in social service provision that account for particular applications and geographies. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 基于AI的稀缺资源分配政策依靠预测来针对特定个体（如高风险群体）或环境（如 Neighborhoods）。个体层面目标策略的近期研究表明存在矛盾结果；一些模型表明当不平等程度高时，目标策略并不实用，而其他研究则表明目标策略具有潜在益处。为研究和调和这一显而易见的分歧，我们基于Mallows模型开发了一个简化框架，以了解不平等的空间分布如何影响逐户访问政策的有效性。我们引入了RENT（相对非目标效率）指标，用以评估在高风险家庭较为集中还是分散的情况下，与基于Neighborho od的方法相比，目标策略在防止承租人被驱逐方面 effectiveness 的差异。然后，我们根据美国某个中型城市收集的驱逐法庭记录校准了模型参数。结果表明，即使在居住隔离程度高且驱逐风险集中的大都市区，通过个体目标策略也能显著增加挨家挨户访问高风险家庭的数量。我们得出结论，前序文献中的显而易见分歧可以通过考虑部署成本的来源以及实际观察到的风险集中度与模型中的风险集中度之间的差异来调和。我们的结果为考虑到特定应用和地理环境的社会服务提供的基于AI的解决方案的部署提供了信息。

# Superclass-Guided Representation Disentanglement for Spurious Correlation Mitigation 

**Title (ZH)**: 面向虚假相关缓解的超类引导的表示解纠缠 

**Authors**: Chenruo Liu, Hongjun Liu, Zeyu Lai, Yiqiu Shen, Chen Zhao, Qi Lei  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08570)  

**Abstract**: To enhance group robustness to spurious correlations, prior work often relies on auxiliary annotations for groups or spurious features and assumes identical sets of groups across source and target domains. These two requirements are both unnatural and impractical in real-world settings. To overcome these limitations, we propose a method that leverages the semantic structure inherent in class labels--specifically, superclass information--to naturally reduce reliance on spurious features. Our model employs gradient-based attention guided by a pre-trained vision-language model to disentangle superclass-relevant and irrelevant features. Then, by promoting the use of all superclass-relevant features for prediction, our approach achieves robustness to more complex spurious correlations without the need to annotate any source samples. Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms baselines in domain generalization tasks, with clear improvements in both quantitative metrics and qualitative visualizations.

# UQGNN: Uncertainty Quantification of Graph Neural Networks for Multivariate Spatiotemporal Prediction 

**Title (ZH)**: UQGNN：图神经网络的时空多变量不确定性量化预测 

**Authors**: Dahai Yu, Dingyi Zhuang, Lin Jiang, Rongchao Xu, Xinyue Ye, Yuheng Bu, Shenhao Wang, Guang Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08551)  

**Abstract**: Spatiotemporal prediction plays a critical role in numerous real-world applications such as urban planning, transportation optimization, disaster response, and pandemic control. In recent years, researchers have made significant progress by developing advanced deep learning models for spatiotemporal prediction. However, most existing models are deterministic, i.e., predicting only the expected mean values without quantifying uncertainty, leading to potentially unreliable and inaccurate outcomes. While recent studies have introduced probabilistic models to quantify uncertainty, they typically focus on a single phenomenon (e.g., taxi, bike, crime, or traffic crashes), thereby neglecting the inherent correlations among heterogeneous urban phenomena. To address the research gap, we propose a novel Graph Neural Network with Uncertainty Quantification, termed UQGNN for multivariate spatiotemporal prediction. UQGNN introduces two key innovations: (i) an Interaction-aware Spatiotemporal Embedding Module that integrates a multivariate diffusion graph convolutional network and an interaction-aware temporal convolutional network to effectively capture complex spatial and temporal interaction patterns, and (ii) a multivariate probabilistic prediction module designed to estimate both expected mean values and associated uncertainties. Extensive experiments on four real-world multivariate spatiotemporal datasets from Shenzhen, New York City, and Chicago demonstrate that UQGNN consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. For example, on the Shenzhen dataset, UQGNN achieves a 5% improvement in both prediction accuracy and uncertainty quantification. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 时空预测在城市规划、交通优化、灾害响应和疫情控制等领域中扮演着关键角色。近年来，，研究人员通过开发先进的的深度学习模型以推进时空预测技术取得了显著进展。现有模型大多是确定性的，即只预测期望值而不量化不确定性，这可能导致潜在的不可靠和不准确的结果。近期最近的研究引入了概率模型来量化不确定性，但它们通常专注于单一现象（例如出租车、自行车、犯罪或 交通事故），从而忽视了这些异质城市现象之间的固有联系。为填补这一研究缺口，我们提出了一种基于图神经网络的不确定性量化模型，简称UQGNN，用于多元时空预测。U adapteuGNN引入了两项创新：（1）一种交互感知的时空嵌入模块， 结合了多元变量扩散图卷积网络和交互感知的时间卷积网络以有效捕捉复杂的时空交互模式；（

# AI Agents and the Law 

**Title (ZH)**: AI代理与法律 

**Authors**: Mark O. Riedl, Deven R. Desai  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08544)  

**Abstract**: As AI becomes more "agentic," it faces technical and socio-legal issues it must address if it is to fulfill its promise of increased economic productivity and efficiency. This paper uses technical and legal perspectives to explain how things change when AI systems start being able to directly execute tasks on behalf of a user. We show how technical conceptions of agents track some, but not all, socio-legal conceptions of agency. That is, both computer science and the law recognize the problems of under-specification for an agent, and both disciplines have robust conceptions of how to address ensuring an agent does what the programmer, or in the law, the principal desires and no more. However, to date, computer science has under-theorized issues related to questions of loyalty and to third parties that interact with an agent, both of which are central parts of the law of agency. First, we examine the correlations between implied authority in agency law and the principle of value-alignment in AI, wherein AI systems must operate under imperfect objective specification. Second, we reveal gaps in the current computer science view of agents pertaining to the legal concepts of disclosure and loyalty, and how failure to account for them can result in unintended effects in AI ecommerce agents. In surfacing these gaps, we show a path forward for responsible AI agent development and deployment. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 随着AI越来越“自主”，它面临着技术和社会法律问题，履行其增强综合生产力和效率的承诺时产生的挑战。从技术和社会法律的角度来看，AI只有在其能够直接代代理执行任务时，能够跟踪代理背后的某些社会法律权责时，才能真正发挥作用。这意味着AI在履行代理权时，需要某些技术和社会法律权责跟踪机制，代理必须承担的某些社会法律责任需要被明确并技术面，，法律层面实现。现行法律框架下，缺乏明确界定代理权和忠诚度的法律权责可能导致AI代理在电子商务时中的潜在不良影响。为填补这些漏洞，，我们提出了一种负责的AI代理开发和部署框架。

# M3-Net: A Cost-Effective Graph-Free MLP-Based Model for Traffic Prediction 

**Title (ZH)**: M3-Net：一种基于MLP的低成本无图交通预测模型 

**Authors**: Guangyin Jin, Sicong Lai, Xiaoshuai Hao, Mingtao Zhang, Jinlei Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08543)  

**Abstract**: Achieving accurate traffic prediction is a fundamental but crucial task in the development of current intelligent transportation this http URL of the mainstream methods that have made breakthroughs in traffic prediction rely on spatio-temporal graph neural networks, spatio-temporal attention mechanisms, etc. The main challenges of the existing deep learning approaches are that they either depend on a complete traffic network structure or require intricate model designs to capture complex spatio-temporal dependencies. These limitations pose significant challenges for the efficient deployment and operation of deep learning models on large-scale datasets. To address these challenges, we propose a cost-effective graph-free Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) based model M3-Net for traffic prediction. Our proposed model not only employs time series and spatio-temporal embeddings for efficient feature processing but also first introduces a novel MLP-Mixer architecture with a mixture of experts (MoE) mechanism. Extensive experiments conducted on multiple real datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed model in terms of prediction performance and lightweight deployment.

# Playing Atari Space Invaders with Sparse Cosine Optimized Policy Evolution 

**Title (ZH)**: 使用稀疏余弦优化策略演化玩 Atari《空间入侵者》游戏技巧 

**Authors**: Jim O'Connor, Jay B. Nash, Derin Gezgin, Gary B. Parker  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08526)  

**Abstract**: Evolutionary approaches have previously been shown to be effective learning methods for a diverse set of domains. However, the domain of game-playing poses a particular challenge for evolutionary methods due to the inherently large state space of video games. As the size of the input state expands, the size of the policy must also increase in order to effectively learn the temporal patterns in the game space. Consequently, a larger policy must contain more trainable parameters, exponentially increasing the size of the search space. Any increase in search space is highly problematic for evolutionary methods, as increasing the number of trainable parameters is inversely correlated with convergence speed. To reduce the size of the input space while maintaining a meaningful representation of the original space, we introduce Sparse Cosine Optimized Policy Evolution (SCOPE). SCOPE utilizes the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) as a pseudo attention mechanism, transforming an input state into a coefficient matrix. By truncating and applying sparsification to this matrix, we reduce the dimensionality of the input space while retaining the highest energy features of the original input. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SCOPE as the policy for the Atari game Space Invaders. In this task, SCOPE with CMA-ES outperforms evolutionary methods that consider an unmodified input state, such as OpenAI-ES and HyperNEAT. SCOPE also outperforms simple reinforcement learning methods, such as DQN and A3C. SCOPE achieves this result through reducing the input size by 53% from 33,600 to 15,625 then using a bilinear affine mapping of sparse DCT coefficients to policy actions learned by the CMA-ES algorithm. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 进化算法以前已被证明是多种领域有效的学习方法。然而，游戏领域的挑战在于视频游戏固有的大量状态空间。随着输入状态规模的扩大，策略规模也需要相应增加以有效学习游戏空间中的时间模式。因此，一个更大的策略将包含更多的可训练参数，从而指数级地增加搜索空间。任何搜索空间的增加都对进化方法来说是极其不利的，因为增加可训练参数数量会与收敛速度成反比。为了在保持输入空间有意义表示的同时减少输入空间的大小，我们引入了稀疏余弦优化策略演化（SCOPE）。SCOPE 利用了离散余弦变换（DCT）作为伪注意力机制，将输入状态转换为系数矩阵。通过截断和应用稀疏化处理此矩阵，我们降低了输入空间的维度，同时保留了原始输入的最高能量特征。我们通过在Atari游戏Space Invaders中使用SCOPE作为策略展示了SCOPE的有效性。在此任务中，SCOPE与CMA-ES结合的表现优于考虑未修改输入状态的进化方法，如OpenAI-ES和HyperNEAT。SCOPE还优于简单的强化学习方法，如DQN和A3C。SCOPE通过将输入尺寸减少53%（从33,600减少到15,625），然后通过CMA-ES算法学习稀疏DCT系数的双线性仿射映射到策略动作，实现了这一结果。

# Empowering Children to Create AI-Enabled Augmented Reality Experiences 

**Title (ZH)**: 赋能儿童创建AI驱动的增强现实体验 

**Authors**: Lei Zhang, Shuyao Zhou, Amna Liaqat, Tinney Mak, Brian Berengard, Emily Qian, Andrés Monroy-Hernández

**Abstract**: Despite their potential to enhance children's learning experiences, AI-enabled AR technologies are predominantly used in ways that position children as consumers rather than creators. We introduce Capybara, an AR-based and AI-powered visual programming environment that empowers children to create, customize, and program 3D characters overlaid onto the physical world. Capybara enables children to create virtual characters and accessories using text-to-3D generative AI models, and to animate these characters through auto-rigging and body tracking. In addition, our system employs vision-based AI models to recognize physical objects, allowing children to program interactive behaviors between virtual characters and their physical surroundings. We demonstrate the expressiveness of Capybara through a set of novel AR experiences. We conducted user studies with 20 children in the United States and Argentina. Our findings suggest that Capybara can empower children to harness AI in authoring personalized and engaging AR experiences that seamlessly bridge the virtual and physical worlds.

# Rethinking Tokenization for Rich Morphology: The Dominance of Unigram over BPE and Morphological Alignment 

**Title (ZH)**: 重新思考分词以适应丰富形态学：单元词在基于频次的分词和形态学对齐之上占据优势 

**Authors**: Saketh Reddy Vemula, Dipti Mishra Sharma, Parameswari Krishnamurthy  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08424)  

**Abstract**: Prior work on language modeling showed conflicting findings about whether morphologically aligned approaches to tokenization improve performance, particularly for languages with complex morphology. To investigate this, we select a typologically diverse set of languages: Telugu (agglutinative), Hindi (primarily fusional with some agglutination), and English (fusional). We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of language models -- starting from tokenizer training and extending through the finetuning and downstream task evaluation. To account for the consistent performance differences observed across tokenizer variants, we focus on two key factors: morphological alignment and tokenization quality. To assess morphological alignment of tokenizers in Telugu, we create a dataset containing gold morpheme segmentations of 600 derivational and 7000 inflectional word forms.
Our experiments reveal that better morphological alignment correlates positively -- though moderately -- with performance in syntax-based tasks such as Parts-of-Speech tagging, Named Entity Recognition and Dependency Parsing. However, we also find that the tokenizer algorithm (Byte-pair Encoding vs. Unigram) plays a more significant role in influencing downstream performance than morphological alignment alone. Naive Unigram tokenizers outperform others across most settings, though hybrid tokenizers that incorporate morphological segmentation significantly improve performance within the BPE framework. In contrast, intrinsic metrics like Corpus Token Count (CTC) and Rényi entropy showed no correlation with downstream performance.

# Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation for Optical Convolutional Networks 

**Title (ZH)**: 光学卷积网络的神经态知识蒸馏 

**Authors**: Jinlin Xiang, Minho Choi, Yubo Zhang, Zhihao Zhou, Arka Majumdar, Eli Shlizerman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08421)  

**Abstract**: Hybrid Optical Neural Networks (ONNs, typically consisting of an optical frontend and a digital backend) offer an energy-efficient alternative to fully digital deep networks for real-time, power-constrained systems. However, their adoption is limited by two main challenges: the accuracy gap compared to large-scale networks during training, and discrepancies between simulated and fabricated systems that further degrade accuracy. While previous work has proposed end-to-end optimizations for specific datasets (e.g., MNIST) and optical systems, these approaches typically lack generalization across tasks and hardware designs. To address these limitations, we propose a task-agnostic and hardware-agnostic pipeline that supports image classification and segmentation across diverse optical systems. To assist optical system design before training, we estimate achievable model accuracy based on user-specified constraints such as physical size and the dataset. For training, we introduce Neural Tangent Knowledge Distillation (NTKD), which aligns optical models with electronic teacher networks, thereby narrowing the accuracy gap. After fabrication, NTKD also guides fine-tuning of the digital backend to compensate for implementation errors. Experiments on multiple datasets (e.g., MNIST, CIFAR, Carvana Masking) and hardware configurations show that our pipeline consistently improves ONN performance and enables practical deployment in both pre-fabrication simulations and physical implementations. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 混合光学神经网络（通常由光学前端和数字后端组成）为实时、电力受限系统提供了与大型完全数字深度网络相比的能源高效替代方案。然而，它们的应用受到两个主要挑战的限制：训练过程中与大型网络相比的准确率差距，以及模拟与制造系统之间的差异，进一步降低了准确率。虽然之前的工作提出了针对特定数据集（如MNIST）和光学系统端到端的优化方法，但这些方法通常缺乏对不同任务和硬件设计的一般性泛化能力。为了解决这些限制，我们提出了一种任务无关和硬件无关的管道，支持跨多种光学系统的图像分类和分割。为了在训练前辅助光学系统设计，我们基于用户指定的约束（如物理尺寸和数据集）估计可实现的模型准确率。在训练过程中，我们引入了神经切线知识蒸馏（NTKD），该方法使光学模型与电子教师网络对齐，从而减小了准确率差距。在制造后，NTKD 还指导数字后端的微调以补偿实现错误。在多个数据集（如MNIST、CIFAR、Carvana Masking）和硬件配置上的实验表明，我们的管道一致地改善了光学神经网络的性能，并在预制模拟和物理实现中实现了实际部署。

# The DNA of nuclear models: How AI predicts nuclear masses 

**Title (ZH)**: 核模型的DNA：AI如何预测核质量 

**Authors**: Kate A. Richardson, Sokratis Trifinopoulos, Mike Williams  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08370)  

**Abstract**: Obtaining high-precision predictions of nuclear masses, or equivalently nuclear binding energies, $E_b$, remains an important goal in nuclear-physics research. Recently, many AI-based tools have shown promising results on this task, some achieving precision that surpasses the best physics models. However, the utility of these AI models remains in question given that predictions are only useful where measurements do not exist, which inherently requires extrapolation away from the training (and testing) samples. Since AI models are largely black boxes, the reliability of such an extrapolation is difficult to assess. We present an AI model that not only achieves cutting-edge precision for $E_b$, but does so in an interpretable manner. For example, we find (and explain why) that the most important dimensions of its internal representation form a double helix, where the analog of the hydrogen bonds in DNA here link the number of protons and neutrons found in the most stable nucleus of each isotopic chain. Furthermore, we show that the AI prediction of $E_b$ can be factorized and ordered hierarchically, with the most important terms corresponding to well-known symbolic models (such as the famous liquid drop). Remarkably, the improvement of the AI model over symbolic ones can almost entirely be attributed to an observation made by Jaffe in 1969. The end result is a fully interpretable data-driven model of nuclear masses. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 获得高精度核质量预测或等效地说核结合能 $E_b$ 的预测 remains an important goal in nuclear-physics research. We present an AI model that not only achieves state-of-the-art precision for $E_b$ but does so in an interpretable manner.

# Processing of synthetic data in AI development for healthcare and the definition of personal data in EU law 

**Title (ZH)**: AI开发中合成数据的处理与欧盟法律中个人数据的定义 

**Authors**: Vibeke Binz Vallevik, Anne Kjersti C. Befring, Severin Elvatun, Jan Franz Nygaard  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08353)  

**Abstract**: Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to transform healthcare, but it requires access to health data. Synthetic data that is generated through machine learning models trained on real data, offers a way to share data while preserving privacy. However, uncertainties in the practical application of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) create an administrative burden, limiting the benefits of synthetic data. Through a systematic analysis of relevant legal sources and an empirical study, this article explores whether synthetic data should be classified as personal data under the GDPR. The study investigates the residual identification risk through generating synthetic data and simulating inference attacks, challenging common perceptions of technical identification risk. The findings suggest synthetic data is likely anonymous, depending on certain factors, but highlights uncertainties about what constitutes reasonably likely risk. To promote innovation, the study calls for clearer regulations to balance privacy protection with the advancement of AI in healthcare. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 人工智能（AI）有潜力革新医疗健康领域，但需访问医疗数据。通过机器学习模型在真实数据上训练生成的合成数据为数据共享同时保护隐私提供了可能。然而，通用数据保护条例（GDPR）在实际应用中存在不确定性，增加了行政负担，限制了合成数据的益处。通过系统分析相关法律来源和实证研究，本文探讨合成数据是否应被视为GDPR下的个人数据。研究通过生成合成数据和模拟推理攻击来考察剩余识别风险，挑战了技术识别风险的常见认识。研究发现，合成数据很可能具有匿名性，这取决于某些因素，但明确合理风险的标准仍存在不确定性。为促进创新，研究呼吁制定更加清晰的法规以平衡隐私保护与医疗健康领域AI的发展。

# Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine 

**Title (ZH)**: 模糊模式特sets林机器 

**Authors**: Artem Hnilov  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08350)  

**Abstract**: The "all-or-nothing" clause evaluation strategy is a core mechanism in the Tsetlin Machine (TM) family of algorithms. In this approach, each clause - a logical pattern composed of binary literals mapped to input data - is disqualified from voting if even a single literal fails. Due to this strict requirement, standard TMs must employ thousands of clauses to achieve competitive accuracy. This paper introduces the Fuzzy-Pattern Tsetlin Machine (FPTM), a novel variant where clause evaluation is fuzzy rather than strict. If some literals in a clause fail, the remaining ones can still contribute to the overall vote with a proportionally reduced score. As a result, each clause effectively consists of sub-patterns that adapt individually to the input, enabling more flexible, efficient, and robust pattern matching. The proposed fuzzy mechanism significantly reduces the required number of clauses, memory footprint, and training time, while simultaneously improving accuracy. On the IMDb dataset, FPTM achieves 90.15% accuracy with only one clause per class, a 50x reduction in clauses and memory over the Coalesced Tsetlin Machine. FPTM trains up to 316x faster (45 seconds vs. 4 hours) and fits within 50 KB, enabling online learning on microcontrollers. Inference throughput reaches 34.5 million predictions/second (51.4 GB/s). On Fashion-MNIST, accuracy reaches 92.18% (2 clauses), 93.19% (20 clauses) and 94.68% (8000 clauses), a ~400x clause reduction compared to the Composite TM's 93.00% (8000 clauses). On the Amazon Sales dataset with 20% noise, FPTM achieves 85.22% accuracy, significantly outperforming the Graph Tsetlin Machine (78.17%) and a Graph Convolutional Neural Network (66.23%).

# Do AI Companies Make Good on Voluntary Commitments to the White House? 

**Title (ZH)**: 人工智能公司是否兑现对白宫的自愿承诺？ 

**Authors**: Jennifer Wang, Kayla Huang, Kevin Klyman, Rishi Bommasani  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08345)  

**Abstract**: Voluntary commitments are central to international AI governance, as demonstrated by recent voluntary guidelines from the White House to the G7, from Bletchley Park to Seoul. How do major AI companies make good on their commitments? We score companies based on their publicly disclosed behavior by developing a detailed rubric based on their eight voluntary commitments to the White House in 2023. We find significant heterogeneity: while the highest-scoring company (OpenAI) scores a 83% overall on our rubric, the average score across all companies is just 52%. The companies demonstrate systemically poor performance for their commitment to model weight security with an average score of 17%: 11 of the 16 companies receive 0% for this commitment. Our analysis highlights a clear structural shortcoming that future AI governance initiatives should correct: when companies make public commitments, they should proactively disclose how they meet their commitments to provide accountability, and these disclosures should be verifiable. To advance policymaking on corporate AI governance, we provide three directed recommendations that address underspecified commitments, the role of complex AI supply chains, and public transparency that could be applied towards AI governance initiatives worldwide. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 自愿承诺是国际人工智能治理的核心，正如白宫、G7、布莱切利公园和首尔最近发布的自愿指南所展示的那样。主要人工智能公司如何兑现其承诺？我们根据他们对白宫2023年八大自愿承诺的公开行为进行评分，发现显著的异质性：虽然评分最高的公司（OpenAI）在我们的评分表中的整体得分为83%，但所有公司的平均得分为52%。公司在模型权重安全方面的系统性表现不佳，平均得分为17%：16家公司中有11家在这一承诺上得分为0%。我们的分析突显出一个明显的关键结构性缺陷，未来的人工智能治理倡议应予以纠正：当公司作出公开承诺时，他们应该主动披露如何满足其承诺以提供问责制，并且这些披露应该是可验证的。为推进企业人工智能治理的政策制定，我们提供了三项有针对性的建议，以解决未充分规定的承诺、复杂的人工智能供应链的角色，以及公开透明的问题，这些建议可以应用于全球范围内的人工智能治理倡议。

# Algorithmic Fairness amid Social Determinants: Reflection, Characterization, and Approach

社会决定因素中的算法公平：反思、表征与方法 

**Authors**: Zeyu Tang, Alex John London, Atoosa Kasirzadeh, Sanmi Koyejo, Peter Spirtes, Kun Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08337)  

**Abstract**: Social determinants are variables that, while not directly pertaining to any specific individual, capture key aspects of contexts and environments that have direct causal influences on certain attributes of an individual. Previous algorithmic fairness literature has primarily focused on sensitive attributes, often overlooking the role of social determinants. Our paper addresses this gap by introducing formal and quantitative rigor into a space that has been shaped largely by qualitative proposals regarding the use of social determinants. To demonstrate theoretical perspectives and practical applicability, we examine a concrete setting of college admissions, using region as a proxy for social determinants. Our approach leverages a region-based analysis with Gamma distribution parameterization to model how social determinants impact individual outcomes. Despite its simplicity, our method quantitatively recovers findings that resonate with nuanced insights in previous qualitative debates, that are often missed by existing algorithmic fairness approaches. Our findings suggest that mitigation strategies centering solely around sensitive attributes may introduce new structural injustice when addressing existing discrimination. Considering both sensitive attributes and social determinants facilitates a more comprehensive explication of benefits and burdens experienced by individuals from diverse demographic backgrounds as well as contextual environments, which is essential for understanding and achieving fairness effectively and transparently. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 社会决定因素是虽不直接针对任何特定个体，但能够捕捉影响个体某些属性的关键环境和上下文变量。以往的算法公平性文献主要集中在敏感属性上，往往忽视了社会决定因素的作用。我们的论文通过引入形式化和定量的严谨性来填补这一空白，将主要由定性建议所塑造的空间纳入其中。为了展示理论视角和实际应用性，我们以大学招生为具体背景，使用地区作为社会决定因素的代理。我们的方法基于地区分析，并使用伽玛分布参数化模型来研究社会决定因素如何影响个体结果。尽管方法简单，但我们的方法定量地恢复了之前定性讨论中共鸣的细微见解，这些见解经常被现有的算法公平性方法所忽略。我们的研究发现表明，仅针对敏感属性的缓解策略在解决现有歧视时可能会引入新的结构性不公。同时考虑敏感属性和社会决定因素有助于更全面地解释来自不同人口背景和环境条件的个体所经历的利益和负担，这对于理解和实现公平性具有重要的意义和透明度。

# HSA-Net: Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Framework for Efficient and Scalable Molecular Language Modeling 

**Title (ZH)**: HSA-Net：高效的可扩展分子语言建模层次和结构感知框架 

**Authors**: Zihang Shao, Wentao Lei, Lei Wang, Wencai Ye, Li Liu  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08334)  

**Abstract**: Molecular representation learning, a cornerstone for downstream tasks like molecular captioning and molecular property prediction, heavily relies on Graph Neural Networks (GNN). However, GNN suffers from the over-smoothing problem, where node-level features collapse in deep GNN layers. While existing feature projection methods with cross-attention have been introduced to mitigate this issue, they still perform poorly in deep features. This motivated our exploration of using Mamba as an alternative projector for its ability to handle complex sequences. However, we observe that while Mamba excels at preserving global topological information from deep layers, it neglects fine-grained details in shallow layers. The capabilities of Mamba and cross-attention exhibit a global-local trade-off. To resolve this critical global-local trade-off, we propose Hierarchical and Structure-Aware Network (HSA-Net), a novel framework with two modules that enables a hierarchical feature projection and fusion. Firstly, a Hierarchical Adaptive Projector (HAP) module is introduced to process features from different graph layers. It learns to dynamically switch between a cross-attention projector for shallow layers and a structure-aware Graph-Mamba projector for deep layers, producing high-quality, multi-level features. Secondly, to adaptively merge these multi-level features, we design a Source-Aware Fusion (SAF) module, which flexibly selects fusion experts based on the characteristics of the aggregation features, ensuring a precise and effective final representation fusion. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our HSA-Net framework quantitatively and qualitatively outperforms current state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 分子表示学习：分子描述和分子性质预测等下游任务的基础，高度依赖于图形神经网络（GNN）。然而，GNN 面临过光滑问题，导致深层GNN层中节点级特征崩溃。尽管已有使用交叉注意力的特征投影方法被引入以缓解这一问题，但在深度特征上表现仍然不佳。这促使我们探索使用Mamba作为替代投影器的可能性，因其能处理复杂序列。然而，我们发现Mamba在保留深层特征的全局拓扑信息方面表现优异，但在浅层特征中忽视了细粒度细节。Mamba和交叉注意力的性能表现出全局-局部权衡。为解决这一关键的全局-局部权衡，我们提出了一种新的框架——分层和结构感知网络（HSA-Net），该框架包含两个模块，能够实现分层特征投影和融合。首先，引入了分层自适应投影器（HAP）模块，用于处理不同图层的特征。它能够动态切换到适用于浅层的交叉注意力投影器和适用于深层的结构感知图-Mamba投影器，产生高质量的多级特征。其次，为了灵活地融合这些多级特征，设计了源感知融合（SAF）模块，根据聚合特征的特性灵活选择融合专家，确保精确有效的最终表示融合。广泛的实验表明，我们的HSA-Net框架在定量和定性上均优于当前最先进的方法。

# Normative Moral Pluralism for AI: A Framework for Deliberation in Complex Moral Contexts 

**Title (ZH)**: 规范性道德多元主义在AI中的框架：复杂道德情境中的审议框架 

**Authors**: David-Doron Yaacov  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08333)  

**Abstract**: The conceptual framework proposed in this paper centers on the development of a deliberative moral reasoning system - one designed to process complex moral situations by generating, filtering, and weighing normative arguments drawn from diverse ethical perspectives. While the framework is rooted in Machine Ethics, it also makes a substantive contribution to Value Alignment by outlining a system architecture that links structured moral reasoning to action under time constraints. Grounded in normative moral pluralism, this system is not constructed to imitate behavior but is built on reason-sensitive deliberation over structured moral content in a transparent and principled manner. Beyond its role as a deliberative system, it also serves as the conceptual foundation for a novel two-level architecture: functioning as a moral reasoning teacher envisioned to train faster models that support real-time responsiveness without reproducing the full structure of deliberative reasoning. Together, the deliberative and intuitive components are designed to enable both deep reflection and responsive action. A key design feature is the dual-hybrid structure: a universal layer that defines a moral threshold through top-down and bottom-up learning, and a local layer that learns to weigh competing considerations in context while integrating culturally specific normative content, so long as it remains within the universal threshold. By extending the notion of moral complexity to include not only conflicting beliefs but also multifactorial dilemmas, multiple stakeholders, and the integration of non-moral considerations, the framework aims to support morally grounded decision-making in realistic, high-stakes contexts. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 本文提出的概念框架集中在开发一个推理论证系统——该系统旨在通过生成、过滤和权衡来自多元伦理视角的规范性论证来处理复杂的道德情境。虽然该框架根植于机器伦理学，但它在价值对齐方面的实质性贡献在于勾勒出了一种系统架构，将结构化的道德推理与时间约束下的行动联系起来。该系统基于规范性的道德多元主义，不是为了模仿行为，而是基于透明和原则性的理由敏感性反思构建。除了作为推理论证系统之外，它还构成了新颖的两层架构的思想基础：作为一个设想中的道德推理教师，旨在培训支持实时响应的更快模型，而不复制推理论证的完整结构。推理论证与直觉组成部分共同设计旨在促进深刻反思和迅速行动。一个关键的设计特征是双混合结构：一个通用层通过自上而下和自下而上的学习来定义道德阈值，一个局部层则在特定情境下学习权衡竞争考虑，并整合文化特定的规范性内容，只要它在通用阈值范围内。通过将道德复杂性的概念扩展到不仅包括冲突信念，还包括多因素困境、多个利益相关者以及非道德考虑的整合，框架旨在在现实、高风险的背景下支持基于道德的决策。

# Algorithmic Collusion of Pricing and Advertising on E-commerce Platforms 

**Title (ZH)**: 电商平台中定价与广告合谋的算法策略 

**Authors**: Hangcheng Zhao, Ron Berman  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08325)  

**Abstract**: Online sellers have been adopting AI learning algorithms to automatically make product pricing and advertising decisions on e-commerce platforms. When sellers compete using such algorithms, one concern is that of tacit collusion - the algorithms learn to coordinate on higher than competitive. We empirically investigate whether these concerns are valid when sellers make pricing and advertising decisions together, i.e., two-dimensional decisions. Our empirical strategy is to analyze competition with multi-agent reinforcement learning, which we calibrate to a large-scale dataset collected from this http URL products. Our first contribution is to find conditions under which learning algorithms can facilitate win-win-win outcomes that are beneficial for consumers, sellers, and even the platform, when consumers have high search costs. In these cases the algorithms learn to coordinate on prices that are lower than competitive prices. The intuition is that the algorithms learn to coordinate on lower advertising bids, which lower advertising costs, leading to lower prices. Our second contribution is an analysis of a large-scale, high-frequency keyword-product dataset for more than 2 million products on this http URL. Our estimates of consumer search costs show a wide range of costs for different product keywords. We generate an algorithm usage and find a negative interaction between the estimated consumer search costs and the algorithm usage index, providing empirical evidence of beneficial collusion. Finally, we analyze the platform's strategic response. We find that reserve price adjustments will not increase profits for the platform, but commission adjustments will. Our analyses help alleviate some worries about the potentially harmful effects of competing learning algorithms, and can help sellers, platforms and policymakers to decide on whether to adopt or regulate such algorithms. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 在线卖家已在电子商务平台上采用AI学习算法自动进行产品定价和广告决策。当卖家使用此类算法进行竞争时，一个担忧是隐性共谋——算法会自学协调以达到高于竞争水平的定价。我们实证研究了卖家共同进行定价和广告决策（即二维决策）时，这些担忧是否成立。我们的实证策略是对多智能体强化学习的竞赛进行分析，并将其校准到从该链接收集的大规模数据集。我们的第一大贡献是在消费者搜索成本高的情况下，找到了学习算法能够促进有利于消费者、卖家乃至平台的双赢或多赢结果的条件。在这种情况下，算法学会协调更低的定价。直觉是算法学会协调较低的广告出价，从而降低广告成本，导致定价下降。我们的第二大贡献是对来自该链接的超过200万产品的大量高频关键词-产品数据集进行了分析。我们对消费者搜索成本的估计显示了不同产品关键词的广泛成本范围。我们生成了算法使用的度量，并发现估计的消费者搜索成本与算法使用指数之间存在负向交互作用，提供了有益共谋的实证证据。最后，我们分析了平台的战略响应。我们发现，保留价格调整不会增加平台利润，而佣金调整会。我们的分析有助于缓解对竞争中的学习算法可能产生有害影响的担忧，并可以帮助卖家、平台和政策制定者决定是否采用或调节此类算法。

# Between Fear and Desire, the Monster Artificial Intelligence (AI): Analysis through the Lenses of Monster Theory 

**Title (ZH)**: 在恐惧与欲望之间：怪兽人工智能（AI）的分析——基于怪兽理论的视角 

**Authors**: Ahmed Tlili  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08318)  

**Abstract**: With the increasing adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in all fields and daily activities, a heated debate is found about the advantages and challenges of AI and the need for navigating the concerns associated with AI to make the best of it. To contribute to this literature and the ongoing debate related to it, this study draws on the Monster theory to explain the conflicting representation of AI. It suggests that studying monsters in popular culture can provide an in-depth understanding of AI and its monstrous effects. Specifically, this study aims to discuss AI perception and development through the seven theses of Monster theory. The obtained results revealed that, just like monsters, AI is complex in nature, and it should not be studied as a separate entity but rather within a given society or culture. Similarly, readers may perceive and interpret AI differently, just as readers may interpret monsters differently. The relationship between AI and monsters, as depicted in this study, does not seem to be as odd as it might be at first. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 随着人工智能（AI）在各个领域和日常活动中的广泛应用，关于AI的优势和挑战以及如何妥善应对相关关切以充分利用AI的讨论日益激烈。为了贡献于这一领域的研究和相关讨论，本研究借鉴怪物理论来解释AI存在的冲突性表现。本文建议，研究流行文化中的怪物可以深入理解AI及其怪异效应。具体而言，本文旨在通过怪物理论的七个命题来讨论AI的认知与开发。研究结果表明，就像怪物一样，AI本质上是复杂的，不应将其视为独立的实体进行研究，而应将其置于特定的社会或文化背景下进行研究。同样，读者可能会以不同的方式感知和解读AI，正如他们可能会以不同的方式解读怪物一样。本文中所描绘的AI与怪物之间的关系，并不像初看上去那么怪异。

# Constrained PSLQ Search for Machin-like Identities Achieving Record-Low Lehmer Measures 

**Title (ZH)**: 受约束的PSLQ搜索以实现勒默度量的历史最低值的Machin-like恒等式 

**Authors**: Nick Craig-Wood  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08307)  

**Abstract**: Machin-like arctangent relations are classical tools for computing $\pi$, with efficiency quantified by the Lehmer measure ($\lambda$). We present a framework for discovering low-measure relations by coupling the PSLQ integer-relation algorithm with number-theoretic filters derived from the algebraic structure of Gaussian integers, making large scale search tractable. Our search yields new 5 and 6 term relations with record-low Lehmer measures ($\lambda=1.4572, \lambda=1.3291$). We also demonstrate how discovered relations can serve as a basis for generating new, longer formulae through algorithmic extensions. This combined approach of a constrained PSLQ search and algorithmic extension provides a robust method for future explorations. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: Machin-like反正切关系是计算$\pi$的经典工具，其效率用Lehmer测度（$\lambda$）量化。我们提出了一种框架，通过将PSLQ整数关系算法与源自高斯整数代数结构的数量理论滤波器耦合，实现大规模搜索的可行性。我们的搜索发现了新的5项和6项关系，其Lehmer测度创下了记录低值（$\lambda=1.4572, \lambda=1.3291$）。我们还展示了如何利用发现的关系为基础，通过算法扩展生成新的更长公式的方法。这种结合了受限PSLQ搜索和算法扩展的方法提供了一种稳健的方法，用于未来的探索。

# Channel-Wise MLPs Improve the Generalization of Recurrent Convolutional Networks 

**Title (ZH)**: 通道 wise MLPs 提高了递归卷积网络的泛化能力 

**Authors**: Nathan Breslow  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08298)  

**Abstract**: We investigate the impact of channel-wise mixing via multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs) on the generalization capabilities of recurrent convolutional networks. Specifically, we compare two architectures: DARC (Depth Aware Recurrent Convolution), which employs a simple recurrent convolutional structure, and DAMP (Depth Aware Multi-layer Perceptron), which extends DARC with a gated MLP for channel mixing. Using the Re-ARC benchmark, we find that DAMP significantly outperforms DARC in both in-distribution and out-of-distribution generalization under exact-match grading criteria. These results suggest that explicit channel mixing through MLPs enables recurrent convolutional networks to learn more robust and generalizable computational patterns. Our findings have implications for neural program synthesis and highlight the potential of DAMP as a target architecture for hypernetwork approaches. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 我们调查了通过多层感知机（MLPs）进行通道级混合对递归卷积网络泛化能力的影响。具体而言，我们比较了两种架构：Depth Aware Recurrent Convolution（DARC，深度感知递归卷积），它采用简单的递归卷积结构，以及DAMP（深度感知多层感知机），它在DARC的基础上加入了门控MLP进行通道混合。使用Re-ARC基准，我们发现，在精确匹配评分标准下，DAMP在分布内和分布外泛化性能上显著优于DARC。这些结果表明，通过MLPs进行显式通道混合能够使递归卷积网络学习到更稳健和泛化的计算模式。我们的发现对神经程序合成具有重要意义，并突显了DAMP架构作为超网络方法目标架构的潜力。

**Abstract**: Transformer architectures have revolutionized artificial intelligence (AI) through their attention mechanisms, yet the computational principles underlying their success remain opaque. We present a novel theoretical framework that reinterprets the core computation of attention as Pavlovian conditioning. Our model finds a direct mathematical analogue in linear attention, which simplifies the analysis of the underlying associative process. We demonstrate that attention's queries, keys, and values can be mapped to the three elements of classical conditioning: test stimuli that probe associations, conditional stimuli (CS) that serve as retrieval cues, and unconditional stimuli (US) that contain response information. Through this lens, we suggest that each attention operation constructs a transient associative memory via a Hebbian rule, where CS-US pairs form dynamic associations that test stimuli can later retrieve. Our framework yields several theoretical insights grounded in this linearized model: (1) a capacity theorem showing that attention heads can store O($\sqrt{d_k}$) associations before interference degrades retrieval; (2) an error propagation analysis revealing fundamental architectural trade-offs of balancing model depth, width, and head redundancy to maintain reliability; and (3) an understanding of how biologically plausible learning rules could enhance transformer architectures. By establishing this deep connection, we suggest that the success of modern AI may stem not from architectural novelty alone, but from implementing computational principles that biology optimized over millions of years of evolution.

# Multi-grained spatial-temporal feature complementarity for accurate online cellular traffic prediction 

**Title (ZH)**: 多粒度时空特征互补性用于准确的在线 cellular 交通预测

**Abstract**: Knowledge discovered from telecom data can facilitate proactive understanding of network dynamics and user behaviors, which in turn empowers service providers to optimize cellular traffic scheduling and resource allocation. Nevertheless, the telecom industry still heavily relies on manual expert intervention. Existing studies have been focused on exhaustively explore the spatial-temporal correlations. However, they often overlook the underlying characteristics of cellular traffic, which are shaped by the sporadic and bursty nature of telecom services. Additionally, concept drift creates substantial obstacles to maintaining satisfactory accuracy in continuous cellular forecasting tasks. To resolve these problems, we put forward an online cellular traffic prediction method grounded in Multi-Grained Spatial-Temporal feature Complementarity (MGSTC). The proposed method is devised to achieve high-precision predictions in practical continuous forecasting scenarios. Concretely, MGSTC segments historical data into chunks and employs the coarse-grained temporal attention to offer a trend reference for the prediction horizon. Subsequently, fine-grained spatial attention is utilized to capture detailed correlations among network elements, which enables localized refinement of the established trend. The complementarity of these multi-grained spatial-temporal features facilitates the efficient transmission of valuable information. To accommodate continuous forecasting needs, we implement an online learning strategy that can detect concept drift in real-time and promptly switch to the appropriate parameter update stage. Experiments carried out on four real-world datasets demonstrate that MGSTC outperforms eleven state-of-the-art baselines consistently.

# MoSSDA: A Semi-Supervised Domain Adaptation Framework for Multivariate Time-Series Classification using Momentum Encoder 

**Title (ZH)**: MoSSDA：一种使用动量编码器的半监督领域适应框架用于多变量时间序列分类 

**Authors**: Seonyoung Kim, Dongil Kim  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08280)  

**Abstract**: Deep learning has emerged as the most promising approach in various fields; however, when the distributions of training and test data are different (domain shift), the performance of deep learning models can degrade. Semi-supervised domain adaptation (SSDA) is a major approach for addressing this issue, assuming that a fully labeled training set (source domain) is available, but the test set (target domain) provides labels only for a small subset. In this study, we propose a novel two-step momentum encoder-utilized SSDA framework, MoSSDA, for multivariate time-series classification. Time series data are highly sensitive to noise, and sequential dependencies cause domain shifts resulting in critical performance degradation. To obtain a robust, domain-invariant and class-discriminative representation, MoSSDA employs a domain-invariant encoder to learn features from both source and target domains. Subsequently, the learned features are fed to a mixup-enhanced positive contrastive module consisting of an online momentum encoder. The final classifier is trained with learned features that exhibit consistency and discriminability with limited labeled target domain data, without data augmentation. We applied a two-stage process by separating the gradient flow between the encoders and the classifier to obtain rich and complex representations. Through extensive experiments on six diverse datasets, MoSSDA achieved state-of-the-art performance for three different backbones and various unlabeled ratios in the target domain data. The Ablation study confirms that each module, including two-stage learning, is effective in improving the performance. Our code is available at this https URL

# XFMNet: Decoding Cross-Site and Nonstationary Water Patterns via Stepwise Multimodal Fusion for Long-Term Water Quality Forecasting 

**Title (ZH)**: XFMNet：通过逐步多模态融合解码跨站点和非平稳水模式的长周期水质预测 

**Authors**: Ziqi Wang, Hailiang Zhao, Cheng Bao, Wenzhuo Qian, Yuhao Yang, Xueqiang Sun, Shuiguang Deng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.08279)  

**Abstract**: Long-term time-series forecasting is critical for environmental monitoring, yet water quality prediction remains challenging due to complex periodicity, nonstationarity, and abrupt fluctuations induced by ecological factors. These challenges are further amplified in multi-site scenarios that require simultaneous modeling of temporal and spatial dynamics. To tackle this, we introduce XFMNet, a stepwise multimodal fusion network that integrates remote sensing precipitation imagery to provide spatial and environmental context in river networks. XFMNet first aligns temporal resolutions between water quality series and remote sensing inputs via adaptive downsampling, followed by locally adaptive decomposition to disentangle trend and cycle components. A cross-attention gated fusion module dynamically integrates temporal patterns with spatial and ecological cues, enhancing robustness to nonstationarity and site-specific anomalies. Through progressive and recursive fusion, XFMNet captures both long-term trends and short-term fluctuations. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets demonstrate substantial improvements over state-of-the-art baselines, highlighting the effectiveness of XFMNet for spatially distributed time series prediction. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 长期时间序列预测对于环境监测至关重要，但由于生态因素引起的复杂周期性、非平稳性和突然波动，水质预测仍然具有挑战性。在需要同时建模时空动态的多站点场景中，这些挑战被进一步放大。为应对这一问题，我们引入了XFMNet，这是一种逐步多模式融合网络，通过遥感降水图像提供河流网络中的空间和环境背景。XFMNet首先通过自适应下采样对齐水质时间序列和遥感输入的时间分辨率，接着进行局部自适应分解以分离趋势和周期成分。一个交叉注意力门控融合模块动态地将时间模式与空间和生态线索相结合，增强对非平稳性和站点特定异常的鲁棒性。通过逐步和递归融合，XFMNet既捕捉长期趋势又捕捉短期波动。在实际数据集上的广泛实验表明，XFMNet在空间分布式时间序列预测方面显著优于现有最先进的基线，突显了XFMNet的有效性。

# Towards Heterogeneity-Aware and Energy-Efficient Topology Optimization for Decentralized Federated Learning in Edge Environment 

**Title (ZH)**: 面向异构性和能效优化的边缘环境中去中心化联邦学习拓扑优化 

**Authors**: Yuze Liu, Tiehua Zhang, Zhishu Shen, Libing Wu, Shiping Chen, Jiong Jin

**Abstract**: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising paradigm within edge computing (EC) systems, enabling numerous edge devices to collaboratively train artificial intelligence (AI) models while maintaining data privacy. To overcome the communication bottlenecks associated with centralized parameter servers, decentralized federated learning (DFL), which leverages peer-to-peer (P2P) communication, has been extensively explored in the research community. Although researchers design a variety of DFL approach to ensure model convergence, its iterative learning process inevitably incurs considerable cost along with the growth of model complexity and the number of participants. These costs are largely influenced by the dynamic changes of topology in each training round, particularly its sparsity and connectivity conditions. Furthermore, the inherent resources heterogeneity in the edge environments affects energy efficiency of learning process, while data heterogeneity degrades model performance. These factors pose significant challenges to the design of an effective DFL framework for EC systems. To this end, we propose Hat-DFed, a heterogeneity-aware and coset-effective decentralized federated learning (DFL) framework. In Hat-DFed, the topology construction is formulated as a dual optimization problem, which is then proven to be NP-hard, with the goal of maximizing model performance while minimizing cumulative energy consumption in complex edge environments. To solve this problem, we design a two-phase algorithm that dynamically constructs optimal communication topologies while unbiasedly estimating their impact on both model performance and energy cost. Additionally, the algorithm incorporates an importance-aware model aggregation mechanism to mitigate performance degradation caused by data heterogeneity. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 联邦学习（FL）在边缘计算（EC）系统中作为一种有前景的范式出现，使大量的边缘设备能够在保持数据隐私的同时协同训练人工智能（AI）模型。为了解决与集中式参数服务器相关的通信瓶颈，研究界广泛探索了基于对等（P2P）通信的去中心化联邦学习（DFL）。尽管研究人员设计了多种DFL方法以确保模型收敛，但其迭代学习过程不可避免地伴随着模型复杂度和参与者数量的增长而产生显著的成本。这些成本受到每次训练周期中拓扑动态变化的影响，尤其是其稀疏性和连通性条件。此外，边缘环境中固有的资源异质性影响了学习过程的能效，而数据异质性则降低了模型性能。这些因素对EC系统中有效DFL框架的设计构成了重大挑战。为此，我们提出了一种基于异质性和集合有效的去中心化联邦学习（DFL）框架——Hat-DFed。在Hat-DFed中，拓扑构造被形式化为一个双优化问题，旨在在复杂边缘环境下最大化模型性能并最小化累积能耗。为了解决这个问题，我们设计了一种两阶段算法，该算法能够动态构建优化的通信拓扑，并无偏地估计其对模型性能和能耗成本的影响。此外，该算法还包含一种基于重要性感知的模型聚合机制，以减轻数据异质性引起的性能退化。

# On the Effects of Smoothing Rugged Landscape by Different Toy Problems: A Case Study on UBQP 

**Title (ZH)**: 关于通过不同的玩具问题平滑崎岖景观效果的研究：一个UBQP案例研究 

**Authors**: Wei Wang, Jialong Shi, Jianyong Sun, Arnaud Liefooghe, Qingfu Zhang, Ye Fan  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19676)  

**Abstract**: The hardness of the Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Program (UBQP) problem is due its rugged landscape. Various algorithms have been proposed for UBQP, including the Landscape Smoothing Iterated Local Search (LSILS). Different from other UBQP algorithms, LSILS tries to smooth the rugged landscape by building a convex combination of the original UBQP and a toy UBQP. In this paper, our study further investigates the impact of smoothing rugged landscapes using different toy UBQP problems, including a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q1 (construct by "+/-1"), a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") and a toy UBQP with matrix ^Q3 (construct randomly). We first assess the landscape flatness of the three toy UBQPs. Subsequently, we test the efficiency of LSILS with different toy UBQPs. Results reveal that the toy UBQP with ^Q1 (construct by "+/-1") exhibits the flattest landscape among the three, while the toy UBQP with ^Q3 (construct randomly) presents the most non-flat landscape. Notably, LSILS using the toy UBQP with ^Q2 (construct by "+/-i") emerges as the most effective, while ^Q3 (construct randomly) has the poorest result. These findings contribute to a detailed understanding of landscape smoothing techniques in optimizing UBQP. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 无约束二阶二次规划问题（UBQP）的难度源于其崎岖的景观。已提出了多种UBQP算法，包括景观平滑迭代局部搜索（LSILS）。与其它UBQP算法不同，LSILS试图通过构建原始UBQP与不同玩具UBQP的凸组合来平滑崎岖的景观。本文进一步研究了使用不同玩具UBQP问题平滑崎岖景观的影响，包括由“+/-1”构建的玩具UBQP、由“+/-i”构建的玩具UBQP以及随机构建的玩具UBQP。首先评估了三种玩具UBQP的景观平坦度，随后测试了使用不同玩具UBQP的LSILS的有效性。结果表明，由“+/-1”构建的玩具UBQP具有最平坦的景观，而由随机方式构建的玩具UBQP则表现出最不平坦的景观。值得注意的是，使用由“+/-i”构建的玩具UBQP的LSILS最为有效，而由随机方式构建的玩具UBQP效果最差。这些发现有助于深入了解优化UBQP的景观平滑技术。

# A New Parallel Cooperative Landscape Smoothing Algorithm and Its Applications on TSP and UBQP 

**Title (ZH)**: 一种新的并行协作景观平滑算法及其在TSP和UBQP中的应用 

**Authors**: Wei Wang, Jialong Shi, Jianyong Sun, Arnaud Liefooghe, Qingfu Zhang

**Abstract**: Combinatorial optimization problem (COP) is difficult to solve because of the massive number of local optimal solutions in his solution space. Various methods have been put forward to smooth the solution space of COPs, including homotopic convex (HC) transformation for the traveling salesman problem (TSP). This paper extends the HC transformation approach to unconstrained binary quadratic programming (UBQP) by proposing a method to construct a unimodal toy UBQP of any size. We theoretically prove the unimodality of the constructed toy UBQP. After that, we apply this unimodal toy UBQP to smooth the original UBQP by using the HC transformation framework and empirically verify the smoothing effects. Subsequently, we introduce an iterative algorithmic framework incorporating HC transformation, referred as landscape smoothing iterated local search (LSILS). Our experimental analyses, conducted on various UBQP instances show the effectiveness of LSILS. Furthermore, this paper proposes a parallel cooperative variant of LSILS, denoted as PC-LSILS and apply it to both the UBQP and the TSP. Our experimental findings highlight that PC-LSILS improves the smoothing performance of the HC transformation, and further improves the overall performance of the algorithm. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 组合优化问题（COP）因其解空间中大量的局部最优解而难以解决。提出了多种方法来平滑COP的解空间，包括旅行商问题（TSP）的同伦凸（HC）变换。本文通过提出一种构建任意规模的一维峰玩具二元二次规划（UBQP）的方法，将HC变换扩展到无约束二元二次规划（UBQP）。我们理论证明了构建的玩具UBQP的一维峰特性。之后，我们利用HC变换框架将该一维峰玩具UBQP应用于平滑原始UBQP，并通过实验证明了平滑效果。随后，我们引入了一种结合HC变换的迭代算法框架，称为景观平滑迭代局部搜索（LSILS）。我们在多种UBQP实例上的实验分析表明LSILS的有效性。此外，本文提出了一种LSILS的并行合作变体，称为PC-LSILS，并将其应用于UBQP和TSP。我们的实验结果表明，PC-LSILS提升了HC变换的平滑性能，并进一步提高了算法的整体性能。
