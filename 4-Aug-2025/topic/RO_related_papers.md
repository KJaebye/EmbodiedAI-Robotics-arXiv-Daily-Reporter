**Abstract**: Recent work has shown that exoskeletons controlled through data-driven methods can dynamically adapt assistance to various tasks for healthy young adults. However, applying these methods to populations with neuromotor gait deficits, such as post-stroke hemiparesis, is challenging. This is due not only to high population heterogeneity and gait variability but also to a lack of post-stroke gait datasets to train accurate models. Despite these challenges, data-driven methods offer a promising avenue for control, potentially allowing exoskeletons to function safely and effectively in unstructured community settings. This work presents a first step towards enabling adaptive plantarflexion and dorsiflexion assistance from data-driven torque estimation during post-stroke walking. We trained a multi-task Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) using collected data from four post-stroke participants walking on a treadmill ($R^2$ of $0.74 \pm 0.13$). The model uses data from three inertial measurement units (IMU) and was pretrained on healthy walking data from 6 participants. We implemented a wearable prototype for our ankle torque estimation approach for exoskeleton control and demonstrated the viability of real-time sensing, estimation, and actuation with one post-stroke participant.

# HannesImitation: Grasping with the Hannes Prosthetic Hand via Imitation Learning 

**Title (ZH)**: HannesImitation: 通过模仿学习使用Hannes假手抓取

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in control of prosthetic hands have focused on increasing autonomy through the use of cameras and other sensory inputs. These systems aim to reduce the cognitive load on the user by automatically controlling certain degrees of freedom. In robotics, imitation learning has emerged as a promising approach for learning grasping and complex manipulation tasks while simplifying data collection. Its application to the control of prosthetic hands remains, however, largely unexplored. Bridging this gap could enhance dexterity restoration and enable prosthetic devices to operate in more unconstrained scenarios, where tasks are learned from demonstrations rather than relying on manually annotated sequences. To this end, we present HannesImitationPolicy, an imitation learning-based method to control the Hannes prosthetic hand, enabling object grasping in unstructured environments. Moreover, we introduce the HannesImitationDataset comprising grasping demonstrations in table, shelf, and human-to-prosthesis handover scenarios. We leverage such data to train a single diffusion policy and deploy it on the prosthetic hand to predict the wrist orientation and hand closure for grasping. Experimental evaluation demonstrates successful grasps across diverse objects and conditions. Finally, we show that the policy outperforms a segmentation-based visual servo controller in unstructured scenarios. Additional material is provided on our project page: this https URL 

**Abstract (ZH)**: Recent advancements in假肢手的控制领域侧重于通过使用摄像头和其他感官输入来增加自主性。这些系统旨在通过自动控制某些自由度来减少用户的认知负担。在机器人学中， imitation learning（模仿学习）已 emerged as a promising approach for learning抓取和复杂操作任务，同时简化数据采集。然而，将其应用于假肢手的控制仍主要未被探索。弥合这一差距可以增强灵巧性的恢复，并使假肢设备能够在更多不受约束的场景下运行，其中任务是通过演示学习而非依赖手动标注的序列来完成的。为此，我们提出了基于模仿学习的HannesImitationPolicy方法，以控制Hannes假肢手，在非结构化环境中实现物体抓取。此外，我们引入了HannesImitationDataset，其中包括在桌子、架子和人对假肢的手递任务中的抓取演示。我们利用此类数据训练单一的扩散策略，并将其部署在假肢手上以预测腕部姿态和手部闭合以实现抓取。实验评估表明，该策略能够成功地在各种物体和条件下进行抓取。最后，我们展示了在非结构化场景中，该策略在性能上优于基于分割的视觉伺服控制器。更多材料可在我们的项目页面获取：this https URL

# Topology-Inspired Morphological Descriptor for Soft Continuum Robots 

**Title (ZH)**: 拓扑启发的形态描述符用于软连续机器人 

**Authors**: Zhiwei Wu, Siyi Wei, Jiahao Luo, Jinhui Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2508.00258)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a topology-inspired morphological descriptor for soft continuum robots by combining a pseudo-rigid-body (PRB) model with Morse theory to achieve a quantitative characterization of robot morphologies. By counting critical points of directional projections, the proposed descriptor enables a discrete representation of multimodal configurations and facilitates morphological classification. Furthermore, we apply the descriptor to morphology control by formulating the target configuration as an optimization problem to compute actuation parameters that generate equilibrium shapes with desired topological features. The proposed framework provides a unified methodology for quantitative morphology description, classification, and control of soft continuum robots, with the potential to enhance their precision and adaptability in medical applications such as minimally invasive surgery and endovascular interventions.
