**Abstract**: Whole-body contact is an effective strategy for improving the stability and efficiency of the motion of robots. For robots to automatically perform such motions, we propose a posture generation method that employs all available surfaces of the robot links. By representing the contact point on the body surface by two-dimensional configuration variables, the joint positions and contact points are simultaneously determined through a gradient-based optimization. By generating motions with the proposed method, we present experiments in which robots manipulate objects effectively utilizing whole-body contact.

# Long Duration Inspection of GNSS-Denied Environments with a Tethered UAV-UGV Marsupial System 

**Title (ZH)**: GNSS受限环境中带有悬挂式UAV-UGV育儿袋系统的长期检测任务 

**Authors**: Simón Martínez-Rozas, David Alejo, José Javier Carpio, Fernando Caballero, Luis Merino

**Abstract**: Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) have become essential tools in inspection and emergency response operations due to their high maneuverability and ability to access hard-to-reach areas. However, their limited battery life significantly restricts their use in long-duration missions. This paper presents a novel tethered marsupial robotic system composed of a UAV and an Unmanned Ground Vehicle (UGV), specifically designed for autonomous, long-duration inspection tasks in Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)-denied environments. The system extends the UAV's operational time by supplying power through a tether connected to high-capacity battery packs carried by the UGV. We detail the hardware architecture based on off-the-shelf components to ensure replicability and describe our full-stack software framework, which is composed of open-source components and built upon the Robot Operating System (ROS). The proposed software architecture enables precise localization using a Direct LiDAR Localization (DLL) method and ensures safe path planning and coordinated trajectory tracking for the integrated UGV-tether-UAV system. We validate the system through three field experiments: (1) a manual flight endurance test to estimate the operational duration, (2) an autonomous navigation test, and (3) an inspection mission to demonstrate autonomous inspection capabilities. Experimental results confirm the robustness and autonomy of the system, its capacity to operate in GNSS-denied environments, and its potential for long-endurance, autonomous inspection and monitoring tasks. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 无人航空车辆（UAVs）已成为由于其高度的机动性和可以访问难以到达区域的能力，在检查和应急响应操作中不可或缺的工具。但是，它们有限的电池寿命严重限制了它们在长时间任务中的应用。本文提出了一种新颖的悬挂育儿机器人系统，该系统由无人机（UAV）和无人地面车辆（UGV）组成，专门设计用于全球导航卫星系统（GNSS）受限环境中自主执行长时间检查任务。该系统通过连接到UGV携带的高容量电池包的绳索供电，从而延长无人机的运行时间。我们基于现成组件详细描述了硬件架构，以确保可复制性，并介绍了由开源组件组成的完整软件框架，该框架基于Robot Operating System（ROS）构建。提出的软件架构使精确定位成为可能，使用直接激光雷达定位（DLL）方法，并确保集成的UGV-绳索-UAV系统的安全路径规划和协调轨迹跟踪。我们通过三项现场实验对系统进行了验证：（1）手动飞行耐力测试以估计运行时间，（2）自主导航测试，（3）检查任务以展示自主检查能力。实验结果证实了该系统的稳健性和自主性，其能够在GNSS受限环境中运行，并具有长时间自主检查和监控任务的潜力。

# UPP: Unified Path Planner with Adaptive Safety and Optimality 

**Title (ZH)**: 统一路径规划器：自适应安全与最优性相结合 

**Authors**: Jatin Kumar Arora, Shubhendu Bhasin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23197)  

**Abstract**: We are surrounded by robots helping us perform complex tasks. Robots have a wide range of applications, from industrial automation to personalized assistance. However, with great technological innovation come significant challenges. One of the major challenges in robotics is path planning. Despite advancements such as graph search, sampling, and potential field methods, most path planning algorithms focus either on optimality or on safety. Very little research addresses both simultaneously. We propose a Unified Path Planner (UPP) that uses modified heuristics and a dynamic safety cost function to balance safety and optimality. The level of safety can be adjusted via tunable parameters, trading off against computational complexity. We demonstrate the planner's performance in simulations, showing how parameter variation affects results. UPP is compared with various traditional and safe-optimal planning algorithms across different scenarios. We also validate it on a TurtleBot, where the robot successfully finds safe and sub-optimal paths. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 我们周围充斥着帮助我们执行复杂任务的机器人。机器人具有广泛的应用范围，从工业自动化到个性化辅助。然而，伴随着巨大的技术创新而来的是重大挑战。机器人技术中的一大挑战是路径规划。尽管有图搜索、采样和潜在场方法等进步，大多数路径规划算法要么专注于最优性，要么专注于安全性。很少有研究同时关注两者。我们提出了一个统一路径规划器（UPP），它使用修改过的启发式方法和动态安全成本函数来平衡安全性和最优性。通过可调参数可以调整安全水平，但这会付出计算复杂度的代价。我们在仿真中展示了规划器的性能，展示了参数变化如何影响结果。UPP与各种传统的和安全-最优路径规划算法在不同场景下进行了比较。我们还在一个TurtleBot上验证了它，结果显示机器人成功地找到了安全且次优的路径。

# Redundancy Parameterization of the ABB YuMi Robot Arm 

**Title (ZH)**: ABB YuMi 机器人臂的冗余参数化 

**Authors**: Alexander J. Elias, John T. Wen  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23111)  

**Abstract**: The ABB YuMi is a 7-DOF collaborative robot arm with a complex, redundant kinematic structure. Path planning for the YuMi is challenging, especially with joint limits considered. The redundant degree of freedom is parameterized by the Shoulder-Elbow-Wrist (SEW) angle, called the arm angle by ABB, but the exact definition must be known for path planning outside the RobotStudio simulator. We provide the first complete and validated definition of the SEW angle used for the YuMi. It follows the conventional SEW angle formulation with the shoulder-elbow direction chosen to be the direction of the fourth joint axis. Our definition also specifies the shoulder location, making it compatible with any choice of reference vector. A previous attempt to define the SEW angle exists in the literature, but it is incomplete and deviates from the behavior observed in RobotStudio. Because our formulation fits within the general SEW angle framework, we also obtain the expression for the SEW angle Jacobian and complete numerical conditions for all algorithmic singularities. Finally, we demonstrate using IK-Geo, our inverse kinematics (IK) solver based on subproblem decomposition, to find all IK solutions using 2D search. Code examples are available in a publicly accessible repository. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: ABB YuMi的7-DOF协作机器人手臂具有复杂的冗余运动学结构。考虑关节限制条件下的YuMi路径规划具有挑战性。冗余自由度由肩-肘-腕（SEW）角度参数化，ABB将其称为臂角度，但路径规划需在外机器人工作室（RobotStudio）模拟器之外明确其精确定义。我们首次提供了SEW角度在YuMi上的完整且经过验证的定义。该定义遵循传统的SEW角度公式，选择肩-肘方向为第四关节轴的方向，并明确肩部位置，使其兼容任何参考矢量的选择。文献中存在定义SEW角度的尝试，但该定义不完整且与RobotStudio中的行为不符。由于我们的公式符合通用的SEW角度框架，我们还获得了SEW角度雅可比矩阵的表达式，并且为所有算法奇异点提供了完整的数值条件。最后，我们使用基于子问题分解的逆运动学（IK）求解器IK-Geo，通过二维搜索找到所有逆运动学解。代码示例可在公众可访问的仓库中获得。

# Spring-Brake! Handed Shearing Auxetics Improve Efficiency of Hopping and Standing 

**Title (ZH)**: 弹簧刹车！手持剪切 miło材料提高跳跃和站立效率 

**Authors**: Joseph Sullivan, Ian Good, Samuel A. Burden, Jeffrey Ian Lipton  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22898)  

**Abstract**: Energy efficiency is critical to the success of legged robotics. Efficiency is lost through wasted energy during locomotion and standing. Including elastic elements has been shown to reduce movement costs, while including breaks can reduce standing costs. However, adding separate elements for each increases the mass and complexity of a leg, reducing overall system performance. Here we present a novel compliant mechanism using a Handed Shearing Auxetic (HSA) that acts as a spring and break in a monopod hopping robot. The HSA acts as a parallel elastic actuator, reducing electrical power for dynamic hopping and matching the efficiency of state-of-the-art compliant hoppers. The HSA\u2019s auxetic behavior enables dual functionality. During static tasks, it locks under large forces with minimal input power by blocking deformation, creating high friction similar to a capstan mechanism. This allows the leg to support heavy loads without motor torque, addressing thermal inefficiency. The multi-functional design enhances both dynamic and static performance, offering a versatile solution for robotic applications.

**Title (ZH)**: 基于眼动驱动的机器人臂共享控制：拟人化研究评估设计选择 

**Authors**: Anke Fischer-Janzen, Thomas M. Wendt, Daniel Görlich, Kristof Van Laerhoven  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23147)  

**Abstract**: Advances in eye-tracking control for assistive robotic arms provide intuitive interaction opportunities for people with physical disabilities. Shared control has gained interest in recent years by improving user satisfaction through partial automation of robot control. We present an eye-tracking-guided shared control design based on insights from state-of-the-art literature. A Wizard of Oz setup was used in which automation was simulated by an experimenter to evaluate the concept without requiring full implementation. This approach allowed for rapid exploration of user needs and expectations to inform future iterations. Two studies were conducted to assess user experience, identify design challenges, and find improvements to ensure usability and accessibility. The first study involved people with disabilities by providing a survey, and the second study used the Wizard of Oz design in person to gain technical insights, leading to a comprehensive picture of findings.

# System Identification for Virtual Sensor-Based Model Predictive Control: Application to a 2-DoF Direct-Drive Robotic Arm 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于虚拟传感器的模型预测控制的系统辨识：以一个两自由度直接驱动机器人手臂为例 

**Authors**: Kosei Tsuji, Ichiro Maruta, Kenji Fujimoto, Tomoyuki Maeda, Yoshihisa Tamase, Tsukasa Shinohara  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.23138)  

**Abstract**: Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) offers a powerful approach for controlling complex nonlinear systems, yet faces two key challenges. First, accurately modeling nonlinear dynamics remains difficult. Second, variables directly related to control objectives often cannot be directly measured during operation. Although high-cost sensors can acquire these variables during model development, their use in practical deployment is typically infeasible. To overcome these limitations, we propose a Predictive Virtual Sensor Identification (PVSID) framework that leverages temporary high-cost sensors during the modeling phase to create virtual sensors for NMPC implementation. We validate PVSID on a Two-Degree-of-Freedom (2-DoF) direct-drive robotic arm with complex joint interactions, capturing tip position via motion capture during modeling and utilize an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) in NMPC. Experimental results show our NMPC with identified virtual sensors achieves precise tip trajectory tracking without requiring the motion capture system during operation. PVSID offers a practical solution for implementing optimal control in nonlinear systems where the measurement of key variables is constrained by cost or operational limitations. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 非线性模型预测控制（NMPC）提供了一种控制复杂非线性系统的强大方法，但面临两个关键挑战。首先，准确建模非线性动力学仍然是困难的。其次，与控制目标直接相关的变量在运行过程中往往难以直接测量。尽管在建模阶段可以使用高成本传感器获取这些变量，但在实际部署中使用这些传感器通常是不可行的。为克服这些局限性，我们提出了一种预测虚拟传感器识别（PVSID）框架，该框架在建模阶段利用临时的高成本传感器创建虚拟传感器，以便NMPC实施。我们在一个具有复杂关节交互的两自由度（2-DoF）直接驱动机械臂上验证了PVSID，通过运动捕捉捕捉末端位置并使用惯性测量单元（IMU）在NMPC中。实验结果表明，我们的NMPC借助识别出的虚拟传感器实现了精确的末端轨迹跟踪，运行时不需要运动捕捉系统。PVSID为在关键变量的测量受限于成本或运营限制的非线性系统中实施最优控制提供了实用解决方案。

# Towards Real-Time Interpolation for Enhanced AUV Deep Sea Mapping 

**Title (ZH)**: 面向实时插值的增强型AUV深海测绘 

**Authors**: Devanshu Saxena  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2505.22675)  

**Abstract**: Approximately seventy-one percent of the Earth is covered in water. Of that area, ninety-five percent of the ocean has never been explored or mapped. There are several engineering challenges that have prevented the exploration of the deep ocean through human or autonomous means. These challenges include but are not limited to high pressure, cold temperatures, little natural light, corrosion of materials, and communication. Ongoing research has been focused on trying to find optimal and low-cost solutions to effective communication between autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), and the surface or air. In this paper, an architecture is introduced that utilizes an edge computing approach to establish computation nearer to the source of data, allowing further exploration of the deep ocean. Taking the most common interpolation techniques used today in the field of bathymetry, the data are tested and analyzed to find the feasibility of switching from CPU to GPU computation. Specifically, the focus is on writing efficient interpolation algorithms that can be run on low-level GPUs, which can be carried onboard AUVs as payload. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 约占地球表面71%的区域被水覆盖。其中，95%的海洋尚未被探索或测绘。通过人力或自主方式进行深海探索面临诸多工程挑战，包括但不限于高压、低温、缺乏自然光照、材料腐蚀以及通信问题。正在进行的科研工作主要集中在寻找有效且低成本的解决方案，以实现自主水下车辆（AUV）与水面或空中平台之间的通信。本文提出了一种利用边缘计算的架构，以便在数据源附近进行计算，从而进一步探索深海。通过测试和分析目前在声学地形测量中最常用的插值技术，研究了从CPU转向GPU进行计算的可行性。具体而言，重点在于开发可在低级GPU上高效运行的插值算法，这些算法可以被搭载在AUV上作为有效载荷。
