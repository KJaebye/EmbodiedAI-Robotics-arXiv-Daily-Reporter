**Abstract**: Autonomous drones have gained considerable attention for applications in real-world scenarios, such as search and rescue, inspection, and delivery. As their use becomes ever more pervasive in civilian applications, failure to ensure safe operation can lead to physical damage to the system, environmental pollution, and even loss of human life. Recent work has demonstrated that motion planning techniques effectively generate a collision-free trajectory during navigation. However, these methods, while creating the motion plans, do not inherently consider the safe operational region of the system, leading to potential safety constraints violation during deployment. In this paper, we propose a method that leverages run time safety assurance in a kinodynamic motion planning scheme to satisfy the system's operational constraints. First, we use a sampling-based geometric planner to determine a high-level collision-free path within a user-defined space. Second, we design a low-level safety assurance filter to provide safety guarantees to the control input of a Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) designed with the purpose of trajectory tracking. We demonstrate our proposed approach in a restricted 3D simulation environment using a model of the Crazyflie 2.0 drone.

# Event Detection for Active Lower Limb Prosthesis 

**Title (ZH)**: 主动下肢假肢的事件检测 

**Authors**: J. D. Clark, P. Ellison  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17649)  

**Abstract**: Accurate event detection is key to the successful design of semi-passive and powered prosthetics. Kinematically, the natural knee is complex, with translation and rotation components that have a substantial impact on gait characteristics. When simplified to a pin joint, some of this behaviour is lost. This study investigates the role of cruciate ligament stretch in event detection. A bicondylar knee design was used, constrained by analogues of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments. This offers the ability to characterize knee kinematics by the stretch of the ligaments. The ligament stretch was recorded using LVDTs parallel to the ligaments of the Russell knee on a bent knee crutch. Which was used to capture data on a treadmill at 3 speeds. This study finds speed dependence within the stretch of the cruciate ligaments, prominently around 5\% and 80\% of the gait cycle for the posterior and anterior. The cycle profile remains consistent with speed; therefore, other static events such as the turning point feature at around 90\% and 95\% of the cycle, for the posterior and anterior, respectively, could be used as a predictive precursor for initial contact. Likewise at 90\% and 95\%, another pair of turning points that in this case could be used to predict foot flat. This concludes that the use of a bicondylar knee design could improve the detection of events during the gait cycle, and therefore could increase the accuracy of subsequent controllers for powered prosthetics. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 准确的事件检测是设计半主动和主动假肢的关键。膝关节的自然运动复杂，包括影响步态特征的平移和旋转成分。简化为铰链关节时，会丢失一些行为特征。本研究探讨了交叉韧带拉伸在事件检测中的作用。采用双髁设计，受前后交叉韧带的类比约束，通过测量韧带的拉伸程度来表征膝关节运动。通过Russell膝的拐杖平台上的LVDT记录前后交叉韧带的拉伸情况，并在跑步机上以三种速度采集数据。研究发现，在步态周期的5%和80%左右，前后交叉韧带的拉伸程度存在速度依赖性；步态周期曲线保持一致，因此可以在90%和95%左右的前后步态周期分别使用前后旋转点作为初始接触的预测前兆；同样在90%和95%左右，可以使用另一对旋转点预测足底阶段。研究结论认为，采用双髁设计的膝关节可以改进步态周期中事件的检测，从而提高后续控制系统的准确性。

**Abstract**: Neurorehabilitation conventionally relies on the interaction between a patient and a physical therapist. Robotic systems can improve and enrich the physical feedback provided to patients after neurological injury, but they under-utilize the adaptability and clinical expertise of trained therapists. In this position paper, we advocate for a novel approach that integrates the therapist's clinical expertise and nuanced decision-making with the strength, accuracy, and repeatability of robotics: Robot-mediated physical Human-Human Interaction. This framework, which enables two individuals to physically interact through robotic devices, has been studied across diverse research groups and has recently emerged as a promising link between conventional manual therapy and rehabilitation robotics, harmonizing the strengths of both approaches. This paper presents the rationale of a multidisciplinary team-including engineers, doctors, and physical therapists-for conducting research that utilizes: a unified taxonomy to describe robot-mediated rehabilitation, a framework of interaction based on social psychology, and a technological approach that makes robotic systems seamless facilitators of natural human-human interaction.

**Authors**: Abdel-Raouf Dannaoui, Johann Laconte, Christophe Debain, Francois Pomerleau, Paul Checchin  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17531)  

**Abstract**: Robust relocalization in dynamic outdoor environments remains a key challenge for autonomous systems relying on 3D lidar. While long-term localization has been widely studied, short-term environmental changes, occurring over days or weeks, remain underexplored despite their practical significance. To address this gap, we present a highresolution, short-term multi-temporal dataset collected weekly from February to April 2025 across natural and semi-urban settings. Each session includes high-density point cloud maps, 360 deg panoramic images, and trajectory data. Projected lidar scans, derived from the point cloud maps and modeled with sensor-accurate occlusions, are used to evaluate alignment accuracy against the ground truth using two Iterative Closest Point (ICP) variants: Point-to-Point and Point-to-Plane. Results show that Point-to-Plane offers significantly more stable and accurate registration, particularly in areas with sparse features or dense vegetation. This study provides a structured dataset for evaluating short-term localization robustness, a reproducible framework for analyzing scan-to-map alignment under noise, and a comparative evaluation of ICP performance in evolving outdoor environments. Our analysis underscores how local geometry and environmental variability affect localization success, offering insights for designing more resilient robotic systems. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 动态室外环境中鲁棒重定位仍然是依赖3D激光雷达的自主系统的一个关键挑战。尽管长期定位已被广泛研究，但发生在几天或几周内的短期环境变化仍未得到充分探索，尽管其具有重要的实际意义。为填补这一空白，我们提出了一个高分辨率的短期多时态数据集，该数据集从2025年2月到4月每周收集数据，覆盖自然和半城市环境。每个会话包括高密度点云地图、360度全景图像和轨迹数据。从点云地图中衍生出的投影激光雷达扫描，通过传感器准确的遮挡模型进行建模，并使用两种迭代最近点（ICP）变体（点到点和点到面）与地面 truth 进行对齐准确性的评估。结果表明，点到面在特征稀疏或植被密集的区域提供了显著更加稳定和准确的注册。本研究提供了一个结构化的数据集，用于评估短期定位的鲁棒性，一个在噪声下分析扫描到地图对齐的可重复框架，以及在演变的室外环境中ICP性能的比较评估。分析强调了局部几何形状和环境变化如何影响定位成功，为设计更具弹性的机器人系统提供了见解。

# Terrain-Aware Adaptation for Two-Dimensional UAV Path Planners 

**Title (ZH)**: Terrain-Aware Adaptation for Two-Dimensional UAV Path Plannerstranslated into中文为：地形意识自适应二维无人机路径规划者

**Abstract**: Multi-UAV Coverage Path Planning (mCPP) algorithms in popular commercial software typically treat a Region of Interest (RoI) only as a 2D plane, ignoring important3D structure characteristics. This leads to incomplete 3Dreconstructions, especially around occluded or vertical surfaces. In this paper, we propose a modular algorithm that can extend commercial two-dimensional path planners to facilitate terrain-aware planning by adjusting altitude and camera orientations. To demonstrate it, we extend the well-known DARP (Divide Areas for Optimal Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning) algorithm and produce DARP-3D. We present simulation results in multiple 3D environments and a real-world flight test using DJI hardware. Compared to baseline, our approach consistently captures improved 3D reconstructions, particularly in areas with significant vertical features. An open-source implementation of the algorithm is available here:this https URL 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 多无人机覆盖路径规划（mCPP）中，商业软件通常仅将研究区域（RoI）视为2D平面，忽视了重要的3D结构特征。这导致在遮挡或垂直表面附近的3D重建不完整。本文提出了一种模块化算法，可以扩展商业2D路径规划器，通过调整高度和相机方向来实现地形感知规划。通过将其应用于著名算法DARP（Divide Areas for Optimal Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning），我们产生了DARP-3D。我们在多个3D环境和使用DJI硬件的实地飞行测试中展示了仿真结果。与基线方法相比，我们的方法在具有显著垂直特征的区域中一致性地提高了3D重建的质量。该算法的开源实现可在以下链接获取：this https URL。

**Title (ZH)**: FAST-Calib: lidar-camera 外参标定一秒完成 

**Authors**: Chunran Zheng, Fu Zhang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17210)  

**Abstract**: This paper proposes FAST-Calib, a fast and user-friendly LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration tool based on a custom-made 3D target. FAST-Calib supports both mechanical and solid-state LiDARs by leveraging an efficient and reliable edge extraction algorithm that is agnostic to LiDAR scan patterns. It also compensates for edge dilation artifacts caused by LiDAR spot spread through ellipse fitting, and supports joint optimization across multiple scenes. We validate FAST-Calib on three LiDAR models (Ouster, Avia, and Mid360), each paired with a wide-angle camera. Experimental results demonstrate superior accuracy and robustness compared to existing methods. With point-to-point registration errors consistently below 6.5mm and total processing time under 0.7s, FAST-Calib provides an efficient, accurate, and target-based automatic calibration pipeline. We have open-sourced our code and dataset on GitHub to benefit the robotics community.

# Reconfigurable Tendon-Driven Robots: Eliminating Inter-segmental Coupling via Independently Lockable Joints 

**Title (ZH)**: 可重构肌腱驱动机器人：通过可独立锁定的关节消除节段间耦合 

**Authors**: Botao Lin, Shuang Song, Jiaole Wang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17163)  

**Abstract**: With a slender redundant body, the tendon-driven robot (TDR) has a large workspace and great maneuverability while working in complex environments. TDR comprises multiple independently controlled robot segments, each with a set of driving tendons. While increasing the number of robot segments enhances dexterity and expands the workspace, this structural expansion also introduces intensified inter-segmental coupling. Therefore, achieving precise TDR control requires more complex models and additional motors. This paper presents a reconfigurable tendon-driven robot (RTR) equipped with innovative lockable joints. Each joint's state (locked/free) can be individually controlled through a pair of antagonistic tendons, and its structure eliminates the need for a continuous power supply to maintain the state. Operators can selectively actuate the targeted robot segments, and this scheme fundamentally eliminates the inter-segmental coupling, thereby avoiding the requirement for complex coordinated control between segments. The workspace of RTR has been simulated and compared with traditional TDRs' workspace, and RTR's advantages are further revealed. The kinematics and statics models of the RTR have been derived and validation experiments have been conducted. Demonstrations have been performed using a seven-joint RTR prototype to show its reconfigurability and moving ability in complex environments with an actuator pack comprising only six motors.

# Falconry-like palm landing by a flapping-wing drone based on the human gesture interaction and distance-aware flight planning 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于人体手势交互和距离感知飞行规划的拍翼无人机类似猎鹰抓握的掌落地技术 

**Authors**: Kazuki Numazato, Keiichiro Kan, Masaki Kitagawa, Yunong Li, Johannes Kubel, Moju Zhao  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17144)  

**Abstract**: Flapping-wing drones have attracted significant attention due to their biomimetic flight. They are considered more human-friendly due to their characteristics such as low noise and flexible wings, making them suitable for human-drone interactions. However, few studies have explored the practical interaction between humans and flapping-wing drones. On establishing a physical interaction system with flapping-wing drones, we can acquire inspirations from falconers who guide birds of prey to land on their arms. This interaction interprets the human body as a dynamic landing platform, which can be utilized in various scenarios such as crowded or spatially constrained environments. Thus, in this study, we propose a falconry-like interaction system in which a flapping-wing drone performs a palm landing motion on a human hand. To achieve a safe approach toward humans, we design a trajectory planning method that considers both physical and psychological factors of the human safety such as the drone's velocity and distance from the user. We use a commercial flapping platform with our implemented motion planning and conduct experiments to evaluate the palm landing performance and safety. The results demonstrate that our approach enables safe and smooth hand landing interactions. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first time to achieve a contact-based interaction between flapping-wing drones and humans.

# Multi-Objective Trajectory Planning for a Robotic Arm in Curtain Wall Installation 

**Title (ZH)**: 幕墙安装中机器人手臂多目标轨迹规划 

**Authors**: Xiao Liu, Yunxiao Cheng, Weijun Wang, Tianlun Huang, Zhiyong Wang, Wei Feng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17140)  

**Abstract**: In the context of labor shortages and rising costs, construction robots are regarded as the key to revolutionizing traditional construction methods and improving efficiency and quality in the construction industry. In order to ensure that construction robots can perform tasks efficiently and accurately in complex construction environments, traditional single-objective trajectory optimization methods are difficult to meet the complex requirements of the changing construction environment. Therefore, we propose a multi-objective trajectory optimization for the robotic arm used in the curtain wall installation. First, we design a robotic arm for curtain wall installation, integrating serial, parallel, and folding arm elements, while considering its physical properties and motion characteristics. In addition, this paper proposes an NSGA-III-FO algorithm (NSGA-III with Focused Operator, NSGA-III-FO) that incorporates a focus operator screening mechanism to accelerate the convergence of the algorithm towards the Pareto front, thereby effectively balancing the multi-objective constraints of construction robots. The proposed algorithm is tested against NSGA-III, MOEA/D, and MSOPS-II in ten consecutive trials on the DTLZ3 and WFG3 test functions, showing significantly better convergence efficiency than the other algorithms. Finally, we conduct two sets of experiments on the designed robotic arm platform, which confirm the efficiency and practicality of the NSGA-III-FO algorithm in solving multi-objective trajectory planning problems for curtain wall installation tasks. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 在劳动力短缺和成本上升的背景下，建筑机器人被视为革命传统建筑方法、提高建筑行业效率和质量的关键。为了确保建筑机器人能够在复杂的建筑环境中高效准确地完成任务，传统的单目标轨迹优化方法难以满足变化的建筑环境的复杂要求。因此，我们提出了一种针对幕墙安装使用的机器人手臂的多目标轨迹优化方法。首先，我们设计了一个集串联、并联和折叠臂元件于一体的机器人手臂，同时考虑了其物理特性和运动特性。此外，本文提出了一种NSGA-III-FO算法（NSGA-III带焦点操作员，NSGA-III-FO），该算法结合了一种焦点操作员筛选机制以加快算法向帕特奥前沿的收敛速度，从而有效地平衡建筑机器人的多目标约束。提出的算法在DTLZ3和WFG3测试函数上进行了十次连续试验，显示出比其他算法更高的收敛效率。最后，我们在设计的机器人手臂平台上进行了两组实验，确认NSGA-III-FO算法在解决幕墙安装任务的多目标轨迹规划问题中的高效性和实用性。

# Dynamic Parameter Identification of a Curtain Wall Installation Robotic Arm 

**Title (ZH)**: 幕墙安装机器人手臂的动态参数识别 

**Authors**: Xiao Liu, Yunxiao Cheng, Weijun Wang, Tianlun Huang, Wei Feng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17136)  

**Abstract**: In the construction industry, traditional methods fail to meet the modern demands for efficiency and quality. The curtain wall installation is a critical component of construction projects. We design a hydraulically driven robotic arm for curtain wall installation and a dynamic parameter identification method. We establish a Denavit-Hartenberg (D-H) model based on measured robotic arm structural parameters and integrate hydraulic cylinder dynamics to construct a composite parametric system driven by a Stribeck friction model. By designing high-signal-to-noise ratio displacement excitation signals for hydraulic cylinders and combining Fourier series to construct optimal excitation trajectories that satisfy joint constraints, this method effectively excites the characteristics of each parameter in the minimal parameter set of the dynamic model of the robotic arm. On this basis, a hierarchical progressive parameter identification strategy is proposed: least squares estimation is employed to separately identify and jointly calibrate the dynamic parameters of both the hydraulic cylinder and the robotic arm, yielding Stribeck model curves for each joint. Experimental validation on a robotic arm platform demonstrates residual standard deviations below 0.4 Nm between theoretical and measured joint torques, confirming high-precision dynamic parameter identification for the hydraulic-driven curtain wall installation robotic arm. This significantly contributes to enhancing the intelligence level of curtain wall installation operations. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 在建筑行业，传统方法难以满足现代对效率和质量的需求。幕墙安装是建筑工程中的关键组成部分。我们设计了一种液压驱动的机器人臂进行幕墙安装，并提出了一种动态参数识别方法。基于测量的机器人臂结构参数建立了Denavit-Hartenberg（D-H）模型，并整合了液压缸动力学，构建了一个由Stribeck摩擦模型驱动的复合参数系统。通过为液压缸设计高信噪比的位移激发信号，并结合傅里叶级数构建满足关节约束的优化激发轨迹，该方法有效地激发了动态模型中参数集的特征。在此基础上，提出了一种分层渐进参数识别策略：使用最小二乘估计分别识别和联合校准液压缸和机器人臂的动力学参数，为每个关节生成Stribeck模型曲线。在机器人臂平台上的实验验证表明，理论和测量的关节扭矩残差标准偏差低于0.4 Nm，证实了液压驱动幕墙安装机器人臂的动力学参数识别具有高精度。这显著提高了幕墙安装操作的智能化水平。

**Authors**: Xiao Liu, Xianlong Yang, Weijun Wang, Wei Feng  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17132)  

**Abstract**: With the rapid development of the construction industry, issues such as harsh working environments, high-intensity and high-risk tasks, and labor shortages have become increasingly prominent. This drives higher demands for construction robots in terms of low energy consumption, high mobility, and high load capacity. This paper focuses on the design and optimization of leg structures for construction robots, aiming to improve their dynamic performance, reduce energy consumption, and enhance load-bearing capabilities. Firstly, based on the leg configuration of ants in nature, we design a structure for the robot's leg. Secondly, we propose a novel structural optimization method. Using the Lagrangian approach, a dynamic model of the leg was established. Combining the dynamic model with the leg's motion trajectory, we formulated multiple dynamic evaluation metrics and conducted a comprehensive optimization study on the geometric parameters of each leg segment. The results show that the optimized leg structure reduces peak joint torques and energy consumption by over 20%. Finally, dynamic simulation experiments were conducted using ADAMS. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in the driving power of each joint after optimization, validating the effectiveness and rationality of the proposed strategy. This study provides a theoretical foundation and technical support for the design of heavy-load, high-performance construction robots.

**Title (ZH)**: MARSCalib：基于球目标的野外及外太空环境多机器人自动稳健外部标定 

**Authors**: Seokhwan Jeong, Hogyun Kim, Younggun Cho  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17130)  

**Abstract**: This paper presents a novel spherical target-based LiDAR-camera extrinsic calibration method designed for outdoor environments with multi-robot systems, considering both target and sensor corruption. The method extracts the 2D ellipse center from the image and the 3D sphere center from the pointcloud, which are then paired to compute the transformation matrix. Specifically, the image is first decomposed using the Segment Anything Model (SAM). Then, a novel algorithm extracts an ellipse from a potentially corrupted sphere, and the extracted center of ellipse is corrected for errors caused by the perspective projection model. For the LiDAR pointcloud, points on the sphere tend to be highly noisy due to the absence of flat regions. To accurately extract the sphere from these noisy measurements, we apply a hierarchical weighted sum to the accumulated pointcloud. Through experiments, we demonstrated that the sphere can be robustly detected even under both types of corruption, outperforming other targets. We evaluated our method using three different types of LiDARs (spinning, solid-state, and non-repetitive) with cameras positioned in three different locations. Furthermore, we validated the robustness of our method to target corruption by experimenting with spheres subjected to various types of degradation. These experiments were conducted in both a planetary test and a field environment. Our code is available at this https URL.

# Shared Control of Holonomic Wheelchairs through Reinforcement Learning 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于强化学习的非完整轮椅共控 

**Authors**: Jannis Bähler, Diego Paez-Granados, Jorge Peña-Queralta  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.17055)  

**Abstract**: Smart electric wheelchairs can improve user experience by supporting the driver with shared control. State-of-the-art work showed the potential of shared control in improving safety in navigation for non-holonomic robots. However, for holonomic systems, current approaches often lead to unintuitive behavior for the user and fail to utilize the full potential of omnidirectional driving. Therefore, we propose a reinforcement learning-based method, which takes a 2D user input and outputs a 3D motion while ensuring user comfort and reducing cognitive load on the driver. Our approach is trained in Isaac Gym and tested in simulation in Gazebo. We compare different RL agent architectures and reward functions based on metrics considering cognitive load and user comfort. We show that our method ensures collision-free navigation while smartly orienting the wheelchair and showing better or competitive smoothness compared to a previous non-learning-based method. We further perform a sim-to-real transfer and demonstrate, to the best of our knowledge, the first real-world implementation of RL-based shared control for an omnidirectional mobility platform.

**Title (ZH)**: 基于自动化协作机器人的雷达辐射pattern获取方法 

**Authors**: Maaz Qureshi, Mohammad Omid Bagheri, Abdelrahman Elbadrawy, William Melek, George Shaker  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16988)  

**Abstract**: Accurate characterization of modern on-chip antennas remains challenging, as current probe-station techniques offer limited angular coverage, rely on bespoke hardware, and require frequent manual alignment. This research introduces RAPTAR (Radiation Pattern Acquisition through Robotic Automation), a portable, state-of-the-art, and autonomous system based on collaborative robotics. RAPTAR enables 3D radiation-pattern measurement of integrated radar modules without dedicated anechoic facilities. The system is designed to address the challenges of testing radar modules mounted in diverse real-world configurations, including vehicles, UAVs, AR/VR headsets, and biomedical devices, where traditional measurement setups are impractical. A 7-degree-of-freedom Franka cobot holds the receiver probe and performs collision-free manipulation across a hemispherical spatial domain, guided by real-time motion planning and calibration accuracy with RMS error below 0.9 mm. The system achieves an angular resolution upto 2.5 degree and integrates seamlessly with RF instrumentation for near- and far-field power measurements. Experimental scans of a 60 GHz radar module show a mean absolute error of less than 2 dB compared to full-wave electromagnetic simulations ground truth. Benchmarking against baseline method demonstrates 36.5% lower mean absolute error, highlighting RAPTAR accuracy and repeatability.

**Authors**: Shanshan Zhang, Tianshui Wen, Siyue Wang, Qi Zhang, Ziheng Zhou, Huiru Zheng, Lingxiang Zheng, Yu Yang  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2507.16865)  

**Abstract**: Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU) has become a key technology for achieving low-cost and precise positioning. However, traditional CNN-based inertial positioning methods struggle to capture the nonlinear motion characteristics and long-term dependencies in IMU data. To address this limitation, we propose a novel inertial positioning network with a generic backbone called ResChebyKAN, which leverages the nonlinear approximation capabilities of Chebyshev polynomials to model complex motion patterns. Additionally, we introduce an Efficient Kernel-based Self-Attention (EKSA) module to effectively capture contextual information and enhance long-term dependency modeling. Experimental results on public datasets (e.g., RIDI, RoNIN, RNIN-VIO, OxIOD, IMUNet, and TLIO) demonstrate that our method reduces the absolute trajectory error by 3.79% to 42.32% compared to existing benchmark methods. Furthermore, we release a preprocessed dataset and empirically show that removing the gravity component from acceleration data significantly improves inertial positioning performance. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 惯性测量单元（IMU）已成为实现低成本高精度定位的关键技术。然而，传统的基于CNN的惯性定位方法难以捕捉IMU数据中的非线性运动特性和长期依赖关系。为了解决这一限制，我们提出了一种新型惯性定位网络，其使用称为ResChebyKAN的通用骨干网络，通过Chebyshev多项式的非线性逼近能力来建模复杂的运动模式。此外，我们引入了一种高效的基于内核的自注意力（EKSA）模块，以有效地捕获上下文信息并提高长期依赖关系建模。在公共数据集（例如，RIDI、RoNIN、RNIN-VIO、OxIOD、IMUNet和TLIO）上的实验结果表明，与现有的基准方法相比，我们的方法可将绝对轨迹误差降低3.79%到42.32%。此外，我们发布了预处理数据集，并通过去除加速度数据中的重力分量实证表明，这显著提升了惯性定位性能。

**Abstract**: The core of the freeway merging control problem lies in dynamic queue propagation and dissipation linked to merging vehicle behavior. Traditionally, queuing is modeled through demand-supply interactions with time varying demand and fixed capacity. However, field observations show flow rates decrease during congestion at freeway merges due to the impact of intersecting traffic, a factor overlooked in fundamental diagrams. This manuscript introduces an analytical approach to characterize and control the dynamic multi-stage merging of autonomous vehicles, prioritizing traffic efficiency and safety. For the first time, the effective discharge rate at the merging point, reduced by the multi-stage dynamic merging process, is analytically derived using a closed form formulation. Leveraging this expression, performance metrics such as queue length and traffic delay are derived as the first objective. Additionally, a crash risk function is established to quantitatively assess potential collisions during the merging process, serving as the second objective. Finally, the problem is formulated as a dynamic programming model to jointly minimize delay and crash risk, with the merging location and speed as decision variables. Given the terminal state, the ramp vehicle merging task is formulated as a recursive optimization problem, employing backward induction to find the minimum cost solution. Numerical experiments using the NGSIM dataset validate the derived effective discharge rate. The results indicate that the proposed model outperforms two benchmark algorithms, leading to a more efficient and safer merging process. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 高速公路汇流控制的核心问题在于与汇流车辆行为相关的动态队列传播和消散。传统上，排队通过需求-供给交互建模，需求随时间变化而固定容量。然而，现场观察表明，在高速公路汇流处拥堵时，流量率会由于交叉交通的影响而降低，这一因素被基础图所忽视。本文引入了一种分析方法，用于表征和控制自主车辆的动态多阶段汇流，优先考虑交通效率和安全。首次通过闭式公式推导了汇流点的有效排放率，该排放率受到多阶段动态汇流过程的影响。利用此表达式，推导出了排队长度和交通延误等性能指标，作为第一目标。此外，建立了碰撞风险函数，以定量评估汇流过程中潜在碰撞的风险，作为第二目标。最后，将问题形式化为基础规划模型，旨在同时最小化延误和碰撞风险，汇流位置和速度作为决策变量。给定终端状态，匝道车辆汇流任务被形式化为递归优化问题，采用逆向归纳法找到最小成本解。使用NGSIM数据集的数值实验验证了推导的有效排放率。结果表明，所提出的模型优于两个基准算法，导致更高效和更安全的汇流过程。

**Abstract**: The intrinsic compliance and high degree of freedom (DoF) of redundant soft manipulators facilitate safe interaction and flexible task execution. However, effective kinematic control remains highly challenging, as it must handle deformations caused by unknown external loads and avoid actuator saturation due to improper null-space regulation - particularly in confined environments. In this paper, we propose a Sensor-Space Imitation Learning Kinematic Control (SS-ILKC) framework to enable robust kinematic control under actuator saturation and restrictive environmental constraints. We employ a dual-learning strategy: a multi-goal sensor-space control framework based on reinforcement learning principle is trained in simulation to develop robust control policies for open spaces, while a generative adversarial imitation learning approach enables effective policy learning from sparse expert demonstrations for confined spaces. To enable zero-shot real-world deployment, a pre-processed sim-to-real transfer mechanism is proposed to mitigate the simulation-to-reality gap and accurately characterize actuator saturation limits. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can effectively control a pneumatically actuated soft manipulator, achieving precise path-following and object manipulation in confined environments under unknown loading conditions. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 冗余软 manipulator 的固有顺应性和高自由度 facilitates 安全交互和灵活任务执行。然而，有效的运动控制仍然极具挑战性，因为它必须处理由未知外部载荷引起的变形，并避免因无效的零空间调节而导致执行器饱和，特别是在受限环境中。在本文中，我们提出了一种传感器空间模仿学习运动控制（SS-ILKC）框架，以在执行器饱和和受限环境约束下实现稳健的运动控制。我们采用了双学习策略：基于强化学习原理的多目标传感器空间控制框架在仿真中训练以开发开放空间中的稳健控制策略，而生成对抗模仿学习方法使在受限空间中从稀疏专家演示中有效地学习策略成为可能。为实现零样本现实世界部署，我们提出了一个预处理的仿真实践转移机制来减小仿真与现实之间的差距，并准确表征执行器饱和极限。实验结果表明，我们的方法能够在未知载荷条件下有效地控制气动驱动的软 manipulator，在受限环境中实现精确的路径跟踪和物体操作。
