This paper presents a distributed trajectory planning algorithm for a quadrotor swarm that operates asynchronously and requires no communication except during the initial planning phase. Moreover, our algorithm guarantees no deadlock under asynchronous updates and absence of communication during flight. To effectively ensure these points, we build two main modules: coordination state updater and trajectory optimizer. The coordination state updater computes waypoints for each agent toward its goal and performs subgoal optimization while considering deadlocks, as well as safety constraints with respect to neighbor agents and obstacles. Then, the trajectory optimizer generates a trajectory that ensures collision avoidance even with the asynchronous planning updates of neighboring agents. We provide a theoretical guarantee of collision avoidance with deadlock resolution and evaluate the effectiveness of our method in complex simulation environments, including random forests and narrow-gap mazes. Additionally, to reduce the total mission time, we design a faster coordination state update using lightweight communication. Lastly, our approach is validated through extensive simulations and real-world experiments with cluttered environment scenarios.', 'abstract_zh': '一种在异步环境下无需持续通信的四旋翼无人机群分布式轨迹规划算法', 'title_zh': 'MC-Swarm: 最小通信多agent轨迹规划及四旋翼机群死锁解决方法'}

Observers based on proprioceptive information can be used for contact detection but have first-order error dynamics, which results in delays. Sensor fusion based on inertial measurement units (IMUs) consisting of accelerometers and gyroscopes is advantageous for reducing delays. The acceleration estimation enables the direct calculation of external forces. For serial robots, the installation of multiple accelerometers and gyroscopes is required for dynamics modeling since the joint coordinates are the minimal coordinates. Alternatively, parallel robots (PRs) offer the potential to use only one IMU on the end-effector platform, which already presents the minimal coordinates of the PR. This work introduces a sensor-fusion method for contact detection using encoders and only one low-cost, consumer-grade IMU for a PR. The end-effector accelerations are estimated by an extended Kalman filter and incorporated into the dynamics to calculate external forces.

The resource limitation issue arises when the data size exceeds the processing capacity of the network or memory, especially when utilizing communication systems or onboard computers in the field. The inter/intra-robot association issue occurs due to the narrow convergence region of ICP under large viewpoint differences, triggering many false positive loops and ultimately resulting in an inconsistent global map for multi-robot systems. To tackle these problems, we propose a distributed LiDAR SLAM framework designed for versatile field applications, called SKiD-SLAM. Extending our previous work that solely focused on lightweight place recognition and fast and robust global registration, we present a multi-robot mapping framework that focuses on robust and lightweight inter-robot loop closure in distributed LiDAR SLAM.

Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful method for controlling AVs in complex marine environments. However, scaling these techniques to a fleet--essential for multi-target tracking or targets with rapid, unpredictable motion--presents significant computational challenges. Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) is notoriously sample-inefficient, and while high-fidelity simulators like Gazebo's LRAUV provide 100x faster-than-real-time single-robot simulations, they offer no significant speedup for multi-vehicle scenarios, making MARL training impractical. To address these limitations, we propose an iterative distillation method that transfers high-fidelity simulations into a simplified, GPU-accelerated environment while preserving high-level dynamics. This approach achieves up to a 30,000x speedup over Gazebo through parallelization, enabling efficient training via end-to-end GPU acceleration. Additionally, we introduce a novel Transformer-based architecture (TransfMAPPO) that learns multi-agent policies invariant to the number of agents and targets, significantly improving sample efficiency. Following large-scale curriculum learning conducted entirely on GPU, we perform extensive evaluations in Gazebo, demonstrating that our method maintains tracking errors below 5 meters over extended durations, even in the presence of multiple fast-moving targets.

Castillo, Dylan Khor', 'link': 'https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08216', 'abstract': "For a general standardized testing algorithm designed to evaluate a specific aspect of a robot's performance, several key expectations are commonly imposed. Beyond accuracy (i.e., closeness to a typically unknown ground-truth reference) and efficiency (i.e., feasibility within acceptable testing costs and equipment constraints), one particularly important attribute is repeatability. Repeatability refers to the ability to consistently obtain the same testing outcome when similar testing algorithms are executed on the same subject robot by different stakeholders, across different times or locations. However, achieving repeatable testing has become increasingly challenging as the components involved grow more complex, intelligent, diverse, and, most importantly, stochastic. While related efforts have addressed repeatability at ethical, hardware, and procedural levels, this study focuses specifically on repeatable testing at the algorithmic level. Specifically, we target the well-adopted class of testing algorithms in standardized evaluation: statistical query (SQ) algorithms (i.e., algorithms that estimate the expected value of a bounded function over a distribution using sampled data). We propose a lightweight, parameterized, and adaptive modification applicable to any SQ routine, whether based on Monte Carlo sampling, importance sampling, or adaptive importance sampling, that makes it provably repeatable, with guaranteed bounds on both accuracy and efficiency. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach across three representative scenarios: (i) established and widely adopted standardized testing of manipulators, (ii) emerging intelligent testing algorithms for operational risk assessment in automated vehicles, and (iii) developing use cases involving command tracking performance evaluation of humanoid robots in locomotion tasks.", 'abstract_zh': '一种标准化测试算法的设计通常会对评估机器人特定方面性能的能力提出几个关键期望。除了准确性（即，与通常未知的真实参考值的接近程度）和效率（即，在可接受的测试成本和设备约束条件下的可行性），特别重要的一属性是可重复性。可重复性指的是不同相关方在同一机器人上执行相似测试算法时，在不同时间和地点一致获得相同测试结果的能力。然而，随着涉及的组件变得更加复杂、智能、多样，最重要的是随机性，实现可重复测试变得越来越具有挑战性。虽然相关努力已在伦理、硬件和程序层面解决了可重复性问题，但本研究特别关注算法层面的可重复测试。具体而言，我们针对标准化评估中广泛采用的测试算法类别——统计查询（SQ）算法（即，使用采样数据估计分布上某种有界函数的期望值的算法），提出了一种轻量级、参数化和自适应修改方法，适用于基于蒙特卡洛采样、重要性采样或自适应重要性采样的任何SQ流程，确保其在准确性和效率方面具有可证明的可重复性。我们通过三个代表性场景证明了所提方法的有效性：（i）广泛采用的操纵器的标准化测试；（ii）自动驾驶车辆运行风险评估的新兴智能测试算法；（iii）类人机器人在行动任务中命令跟踪性能评估的新兴应用场景。', 'title_zh': '重新思考用于评估机器人性能的可重复度量方法：基于统计查询'}

HandCept addresses the difficulty of achieving accurate and robust joint angle estimation in dynamic environments where both visual and inertial measurements are prone to noise and drift. It leverages a zero-shot learning approach using a wrist-mounted RGB-D camera and 9-axis IMUs, fused in real time via a latency-free Extended Kalman Filter (EKF).

In this work, we propose a tightly coupled motion capture approach that directly integrates IMU measurements with multibody dynamic models via an Iterated Extended Kalman Filter (IEKF) to simultaneously estimate the system's kinematics and kinetics. By enforcing kinematic and kinetic properties and utilizing only accelerometer and gyroscope data, our method improves IMU-based state estimation accuracy. Our approach is designed to allow for incorporating additional sensor data, such as optical MoCap measurements and joint torque readings, to further enhance estimation accuracy.

We demonstrate a maximum Root Mean Square Difference (RMSD) in the pendulum's computed joint angles of 3.75 degrees compared to optical MoCap Inverse Kinematics (IK), which serves as the gold standard in the absence of internal encoders. For the Kuka robot, we observe a maximum joint angle RMSD of 3.24 degrees compared to the Kuka's internal encoders, while the maximum joint angle RMSD of the optical MoCap IK compared to the encoders was 1.16 degrees.

To illustrate this point, we analyze a periodic motion of the Planar Vertical Take-Off and Landing (PVTOL) aircraft. The corresponding phase trajectory and reference control input are analytic functions. We demonstrate the stabilizability of this solution by constructing a feedback controller that ensures asymptotic orbital stability.

The objective is to achieve the fastest time, shortest distance, and fewest number of path segments to satisfy motion requirements, while avoiding sensor blind-spots.
