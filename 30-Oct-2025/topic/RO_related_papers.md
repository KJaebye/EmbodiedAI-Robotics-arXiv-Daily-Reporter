**Abstract**: Surgical suturing is a high-precision task that impacts patient healing and scarring. Suturing skill varies widely between surgeons, highlighting the need for robot assistance. Previous robot suturing works, such as STITCH 1.0 [1], struggle to fully close wounds due to inaccurate needle tracking and poor thread management. To address these challenges, we present STITCH 2.0, an elevated augmented dexterity pipeline with seven improvements including: improved EKF needle pose estimation, new thread untangling methods, and an automated 3D suture alignment algorithm. Experimental results over 15 trials find that STITCH 2.0 on average achieves 74.4% wound closure with 4.87 sutures per trial, representing 66% more sutures in 38% less time compared to the previous baseline. When two human interventions are allowed, STITCH 2.0 averages six sutures with 100% wound closure rate. Project website: this https URL 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 手术缝合是一项高精度任务，影响患者的愈合和疤痕形成。外科医生之间的缝合技能差异大，凸显了机器人辅助的必要性。先前的机器人缝合工作，如STITCH 1.0，在针位置跟踪不准确和线管理不佳的情况下，难以完全闭合伤口。为了解决这些问题，我们呈现了STITCH 2.0，这是一个提升的增强灵巧性管道，包括七项改进：改进的EKF针位姿估计、新的线解纠缠方法以及自动3D缝合对齐算法。在15次试验中，STITCH 2.0平均实现74.4%的伤口闭合，每实验使用4.87针，相比先前基线，在时间减少38%的情况下增加了66%的缝合数量。允许两次人类干预时，STITCH 2.0平均使用6针实现100%的伤口闭合率。项目网站：https://this-url

# Modeling Collapse of Steered Vine Robots Under Their Own Weight 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于自身重量的牵引攀爬机器人坍塌建模 

**Authors**: Ciera McFarland, Margaret McGuinness  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25727)  

**Abstract**: Soft, vine-inspired growing robots that move by eversion are highly mobile in confined environments, but, when faced with gaps in the environment, they may collapse under their own weight while navigating a desired path. In this work, we present a comprehensive collapse model that can predict the collapse length of steered robots in any shape using true shape information and tail tension. We validate this model by collapsing several unsteered robots without true shape information. The model accurately predicts the trends of those experiments. We then attempt to collapse a robot steered with a single actuator at different orientations. Our models accurately predict collapse when it occurs. Finally, we demonstrate how this could be used in the field by having a robot attempt a gap-crossing task with and without inflating its actuators. The robot needs its actuators inflated to cross the gap without collapsing, which our model supports. Our model has been specifically tested on straight and series pouch motor-actuated robots made of non-stretchable material, but it could be applied to other robot variations. This work enables us to model the robot's collapse behavior in any open environment and understand the parameters it needs to succeed in 3D navigation tasks. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 受藤本植物启发的软体攀爬机器人通过逆转方式移动，在受限环境中高度灵活，但在面对环境中的空隙时，可能在导航目标路径时因自身重量而坍塌。在这项工作中，我们提出了一种综合的坍塌模型，可以使用真实的形状信息和尾巴张力预测任何形状的导向机器人的坍塌长度。我们通过使几个未导向的机器人坍塌而没有真实形状信息来验证该模型，该模型准确地预测了这些实验的趋势。然后，我们尝试使用单个执行器以不同方向导向使机器人坍塌。我们的模型准确地预测了其坍塌的发生。最后，我们展示了如何将其应用到实际任务中，让机器人在有和没有膨胀其执行器的情况下尝试跨越空隙任务。机器人需要其执行器膨胀才能跨越空隙而不坍塌，这得到了我们模型的支持。该模型已在非伸缩材料制成的直行和系列囊状电机驱动机器人上进行了专门测试，但可用于其他机器人变化。这项工作使我们能够模拟机器人在任何开放环境中的坍塌行为，并理解其在三维导航任务中成功所需的参数。

# Collision avoidance and path finding in a robotic mobile fulfillment system using multi-objective meta-heuristics 

**Title (ZH)**: 使用多目标元启发式方法在机器人移动 fulfillment 系统中的碰撞避免与路径规划 

**Authors**: Ahmad Kokhahi, Mary Kurz  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25650)  

**Abstract**: Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has gained significant attention, with most research focusing on minimizing collisions and travel time. This paper also considers energy consumption in the path planning of automated guided vehicles (AGVs). It addresses two main challenges: i) resolving collisions between AGVs and ii) assigning tasks to AGVs. We propose a new collision avoidance strategy that takes both energy use and travel time into account. For task assignment, we present two multi-objective algorithms: Non-Dominated Sorting Genetic Algorithm (NSGA) and Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search (ALNS). Comparative evaluations show that these proposed methods perform better than existing approaches in both collision avoidance and task assignment. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 多代理路径规划（MAPF）引起了广泛关注，大多数研究集中于减少碰撞和旅行时间。本文还考虑了在自动引导车（AGVs）的路径规划中能源消耗的问题。本文主要解决两个挑战：i) AGVs之间的碰撞解决，ii) 任务分配。我们提出了一种新的碰撞避免策略，考虑了能源使用和旅行时间。在任务分配方面，我们提出了两种多目标算法：非支配排序遗传算法（NSGA）和自适应大邻域搜索（ALNS）。比较评价表明，这些提出的方法在碰撞避免和任务分配上都优于现有方法。

# Octopus-like Reaching Motion: A Perspective Inspired by Whipping 

**Title (ZH)**: 类吸盘抓取运动：鞭打启发的新视角 

**Authors**: Shengyao Zhang, Yiyuan Zhang, Chenrui Zhang, Yiming Li, Wenci Xin, Yuliang Liufu, Hong Wei Ng, Cecilia Laschi

**Abstract**: The stereotypical reaching motion of the octopus arm has drawn growing attention for its efficient control of a highly deformable body. Previous studies suggest that its characteristic bend propagation may share underlying principles with the dynamics of a whip. This work investigates whether whip-like passive dynamics in water can reproduce the kinematic features observed in biological reaching and their similarities and differences. Platform-based whipping tests were performed in water and air while systematically varying material stiffness and driving speed. Image-based quantification revealed that the Ecoflex Gel 2 arm driven at 150 rpm (motor speed) reproduced curvature propagation similar to that observed in octopus reaching. However, its bend-point velocity decreased monotonically rather than exhibiting the biological bell-shaped profile, confirming that the octopus reaching movement is not merely a passive whipping behavior. The absence of propagation in air further highlights the critical role of the surrounding medium in forming octopus-like reaching motion. This study provides a new perspective for understand biological reaching movement, and offers a potential platform for future hydrodynamic research.

# Combining Moving Mass Actuators and Manoeuvring Models for Underwater Vehicles: A Lagrangian Approach 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于拉格朗日方法结合移动质量执行机构和航行器模型的水下自主航行器控制 

**Authors**: Alexander B. Rambech, Ivar B. Saksvik, Vahid Hassani  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25479)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we present a Newton-Euler formulation of the equations of motion for underwater vehicles with an interntal moving mass actuator. Furthermore, the moving mass dynamics are expressed as an extension to the manoeuvring model for underwater vehicles, originally introduced by Fossen (1991). The influence of the moving mass is described in body-frame and included as states in both an additional kinematic equation and as part of the coupled rigid-body kinetics of the underwater vehicle. The Coriolis-centripetal effects are derived from Kirchhoff's equations and the hydrostatics are derived using first principals. The proposed Newton-Euler model is validated through simulation and compared with the traditional Hamiltonian internal moving mass actuator formulation.

# Solving the Right Problem with Multi-Robot Formations 

**Title (ZH)**: 多机器人编队解决正确的问题 

**Authors**: Chaz Cornwall, Jeremy P. Bos  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25422)  

**Abstract**: Formation control simplifies minimizing multi-robot cost functions by encoding a cost function as a shape the robots maintain. However, by reducing complex cost functions to formations, discrepancies arise between maintaining the shape and minimizing the original cost function. For example, a Diamond or Box formation shape is often used for protecting all members of the formation. When more information about the surrounding environment becomes available, a static shape often no longer minimizes the original protection cost. We propose a formation planner to reduce mismatch between a formation and the cost function while still leveraging efficient formation controllers. Our formation planner is a two-step optimization problem that identifies desired relative robot positions. We first solve a constrained problem to estimate non-linear and non-differentiable costs with a weighted sum of surrogate cost functions. We theoretically analyze this problem and identify situations where weights do not need to be updated. The weighted, surrogate cost function is then minimized using relative positions between robots. The desired relative positions are realized using a non-cooperative formation controller derived from Lyapunov's direct approach. We then demonstrate the efficacy of this approach for military-like costs such as protection and obstacle avoidance. In simulations, we show a formation planner can reduce a single cost by over 75%. When minimizing a variety of cost functions simultaneously, using a formation planner with adaptive weights can reduce the cost by 20-40%. Formation planning provides better performance by minimizing a surrogate cost function that closely approximates the original cost function instead of relying on a shape abstraction. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 形成控制通过将成本函数编码为机器人保持的形状来简化多机器人成本函数的最小化，但通过将复杂成本函数简化为形成，会在保持形状和最小化原始成本函数之间产生差异。我们提出了一种形成规划器，以减少形成与成本函数之间的不匹配，同时利用高效的形成控制器。我们的形成规划器是一个两步优化问题，用于识别期望的机器人相对位置。首先，我们解决一个约束问题，使用加权的代理成本函数之和来估算非线性且非可微的成本。我们对该问题进行理论分析，并确定不需要更新权重的情况。然后，我们使用机器人之间的相对位置来最小化加权代理成本函数。期望的机器人相对位置通过由李雅普诺夫直接方法导出的非合作形成控制器来实现。然后，我们展示了这种规划方法在类似军事的成本如保护和障碍物避免方面的有效性。在仿真中，我们展示了形成规划器可以使单个成本减少超过75%。在同时最小化多种成本函数时，使用具有自适应权重的形成规划器可以使成本减少20-40%。形成规划通过最小化一个接近原始成本函数的代理成本函数，而非依赖形状抽象，提供更好的性能。

# Geometric Robot Calibration Using a Calibration Plate 

**Title (ZH)**: 使用标定板的几何机器人标定 

**Authors**: Bernhard Rameder, Hubert Gattringer, Andreas Mueller  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25338)  

**Abstract**: In this paper a new method for geometric robot calibration is introduced, which uses a calibration plate with precisely known distances between its measuring points. The relative measurement between two points on the calibration plate is used to determine predefined error parameters of the system. In comparison to conventional measurement methods, like laser tracker or motion capture systems, the calibration plate provides a more mechanically robust and cheaper alternative, which is furthermore easier to transport due to its small size. The calibration method, the plate design, the mathematical description of the error system as well as the identification of the parameters are described in detail. For identifying the error parameters, the least squares method and a constrained optimization problem are used. The functionality of this method was demonstrated in experiments that led to promising results, correlated with one of a laser tracker calibration. The modeling and identification of the error parameters is done for a gantry machine, but is not restricted to that type of robot.

# An approach for combining transparency and motion assistance of a lower body exoskeleton 

**Title (ZH)**: 一种结合下肢外骨骼透明度和运动辅助的方法 

**Authors**: Jakob Ziegler, Bernhard Rameder, Hubert Gattringer, Andreas Mueller  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25335)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, an approach for gait assistance with a lower body exoskeleton is described. Two concepts, transparency and motion assistance, are combined. The transparent mode, where the system is following the user's free motion with a minimum of perceived interaction forces, is realized by exploiting the gear backlash of the actuation units. During walking a superimposed assistance mode applies an additional torque guiding the legs to their estimated future position. The concept of adaptive oscillators is utilized to learn the quasi-periodic signals typical for locomotion. First experiments showed promising results.

# Development of Implicit-Explicit Control Based Amphibious Centipede-Type Robot and Evaluation of its Mobile Performance 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于隐式-显式控制的 Amphibious 千足虫型机器人开发及其移动性能评价 

**Authors**: Yusuke Tsunoda, Seiya Yamamoto, Kazuki Ito, Runze Xiao, Keisuke Naniwa, Koichi Osuka  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25280)  

**Abstract**: Multi-legged mobile robots possess high mobility performance in rough terrain environments, stemming from their high postural stability, joint flexibility, and the redundancy provided by multiple legs. In prior research on navigating between different environments such as land and water, the primary strategy employed involves switching to a controller that generates an appropriate gait for the new environment upon entering it. However, designing appropriate gaits for each complex and diverse environment and accurately determining controller switching for each environment is challenging. Therefore, this research develops a centipede-type mobile robot that navigates both aquatic and terrestrial environments with a simple, unified control scheme, based on the implicit-explicit control philosophy and by ingeniously designing the robot's body structure. In this research, we developed the robot featuring flexible joints and left and right legs on each body segment and focused on the leg structure which has extensive contact with the environment. This paper evaluates the locomotion performance on land and water using the three developed leg structures, using the robot's leg slip rate and actuator energy consumption as evaluation metrics. The experimental results confirmed the existence of an appropriate leg structure capable of navigating both aquatic and terrestrial environments under identical control.

# Time-Optimal Transport of Loosely Placed Liquid Filled Cups along Prescribed Paths 

**Title (ZH)**: 沿指定路径运输松散放置的液体填充杯的时间最优传输 

**Authors**: Klaus Zauner, Hubert Gattringer, Andreas Mueller  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25255)  

**Abstract**: Handling loosely placed objects with robotic manipulators is a difficult task from the point of view of trajectory planning and control. This becomes even more challenging when the object to be handled is a container filled with liquid. This paper addresses the task of transporting a liquid-filled cup placed on a tray along a prescribed path in shortest time. The objective is to minimize swapping, thus avoiding spillage of the fluid. To this end, the sloshing dynamics is incorporated into the dynamic model used within the optimal control problem formulation. The optimization problem is solved using a direct multiple shooting approach.

**Title (ZH)**: 平均位移理论及其在群体机器人中的应用：增强多机器人协作效率的新途径 

**Authors**: Guibin Sun, Jinhu Lü, Kexin Liu, Zhenqian Wang, Guanrong Chen

**Abstract**: Swarms evolving from collective behaviors among multiple individuals are commonly seen in nature, which enables biological systems to exhibit more efficient and robust collaboration. Creating similar swarm intelligence in engineered robots poses challenges to the design of collaborative algorithms that can be programmed at large scales. The assignment-based method has played an eminent role for a very long time in solving collaboration problems of robot swarms. However, it faces fundamental limitations in terms of efficiency and robustness due to its unscalability to swarm variants. This article presents a tutorial review on recent advances in assignment-free collaboration of robot swarms, focusing on the problem of shape formation. A key theoretical component is the recently developed \emph{mean-shift exploration} strategy, which improves the collaboration efficiency of large-scale swarms by dozens of times. Further, the efficiency improvement is more significant as the swarm scale increases. Finally, this article discusses three important applications of the mean-shift exploration strategy, including precise shape formation, area coverage formation, and maneuvering formation, as well as their corresponding industrial scenarios in smart warehousing, area exploration, and cargo transportation.

# Non-Invasive Calibration Of A Stewart Platform By Photogrammetry 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于摄影测量的非侵入式 Stewart 平台标定 

**Authors**: Sourabh Karmakar, Cameron J. Turner  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.25072)  

**Abstract**: Accurate calibration of a Stewart platform is important for their precise and efficient operation. However, the calibration of these platforms using forward kinematics is a challenge for researchers because forward kinematics normally generates multiple feasible and unfeasible solutions for any pose of the moving platform. The complex kinematic relations among the six actuator paths connecting the fixed base to the moving platform further compound the difficulty in establishing a straightforward and efficient calibration method. The authors developed a new forward kinematics-based calibration method using Denavit-Hartenberg convention and used the Stewart platform Tiger 66.1 developed in their lab for experimenting with the photogrammetry-based calibration strategies described in this paper. This system became operational upon completion of construction, marking its inaugural use. The authors used their calibration model for estimating the errors in the system and adopted three compensation options or strategies as per Least Square method to improve the accuracy of the system. These strategies leveraged a high-resolution digital camera and off-the-shelf software to capture the poses of the moving platform's center. This process is non-invasive and does not need any additional equipment to be attached to the hexapod or any alteration of the hexapod hardware. This photogrammetry-based calibration process involves multiple high-resolution images from different angles to measure the position and orientation of the platform center in the three-dimensional space. The Target poses and Actual poses are then compared, and the error compensations are estimated using the Least-Squared methods to calculate the Predicted poses. Results from each of the three compensation approaches demonstrated noticeable enhancements in platform pose accuracies, suggesting room for further improvements.

**Title (ZH)**: 使用分段Bezier曲线进行具有安全余量的平滑路径规划 

**Authors**: Iancu Andrei, Marius Kloetzer, Cristian Mahulea, Catalin Dosoftei  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2510.24972)  

**Abstract**: In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient quadratic programming (QP) approach for generating smooth, $C^1$ continuous paths for mobile robots using piece-wise quadratic Bezier (PWB) curves. Our method explicitly incorporates safety margins within a structured optimization framework, balancing trajectory smoothness and robustness with manageable numerical complexity suitable for real-time and embedded applications. Comparative simulations demonstrate clear advantages over traditional piece-wise linear (PWL) path planning methods, showing reduced trajectory deviations, enhanced robustness, and improved overall path quality. These benefits are validated through simulations using a Pure-Pursuit controller in representative scenarios, highlighting the practical effectiveness and scalability of our approach for safe navigation. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 本文提出了一种计算高效的二次规划（QP）方法，用于利用分段二次贝zier（PWB）曲线生成移动机器人平滑且$C^1$连续的路径。该方法在结构化的优化框架中明确地引入了安全裕量，平衡了轨迹的平滑性和鲁棒性，并且具有可管理的数值复杂性，适用于实时和嵌入式应用。与传统的分段线性（PWL）路径规划方法相比，比较仿真展示了明显的优点，包括轨迹偏差减小、鲁棒性增强和整体路径质量提高。这些优势通过使用纯追赶控制器在代表性场景下的仿真得到验证，突显了该方法在安全导航中的实用效果和可扩展性。
