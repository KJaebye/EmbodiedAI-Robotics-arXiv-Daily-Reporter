**Abstract**: This paper presents a rigorous evaluation of Real-to-Sim parameter estimation approaches for fabric manipulation in robotics. The study systematically assesses three state-of-the-art approaches, namely two differential pipelines and a data-driven approach. We also devise a novel physics-informed neural network approach for physics parameter estimation. These approaches are interfaced with two simulations across multiple Real-to-Sim scenarios (lifting, wind blowing, and stretching) for five different fabric types and evaluated on three unseen scenarios (folding, fling, and shaking). We found that the simulation engines and the choice of Real-to-Sim approaches significantly impact fabric manipulation performance in our evaluation scenarios. Moreover, PINN observes superior performance in quasi-static tasks but shows limitations in dynamic scenarios.

# Asymptotically Optimal Path Planning With an Approximation of the Omniscient Set 

**Title (ZH)**: 自 Optim 化路径规划与全知集近似 

**Authors**: Jonáš Kříž, Vojtěch Vonásek

**Abstract**: The asymptotically optimal version of Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT*) is often used to find optimal paths in a high-dimensional configuration space. The well-known issue of RRT* is its slow convergence towards the optimal solution. A possible solution is to draw random samples only from a subset of the configuration space that is known to contain configurations that can improve the cost of the path (omniscient set). A fast convergence rate may be achieved by approximating the omniscient with a low-volume set. In this letter, we propose new methods to approximate the omniscient set and methods for their effective sampling. First, we propose to approximate the omniscient set using several (small) hyperellipsoids defined by sections of the current best solution. The second approach approximates the omniscient set by a convex hull computed from the current solution. Both approaches ensure asymptotical optimality and work in a general n-dimensional configuration space. The experiments have shown superior performance of our approaches in multiple scenarios in 3D and 6D configuration spaces. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 急速扩展随机树（RRT*）的渐近最优版本常用于在高维配置空间中寻找最优路径。本文提出了一种新的方法来近似全知集合，并有效地对其进行采样。首先，我们提出使用若干由当前最佳解部分定义的超椭球体来近似全知集合。第二种方法通过从当前解计算凸包来近似全知集合。两种方法在一般n维配置空间中保证渐近最优性。实验表明，在3D和6D配置空间的多个场景中，我们的方法表现出优越的性能。

# The Morphology-Control Trade-Off: Insights into Soft Robotic Efficiency 

**Title (ZH)**: 形态控制权衡：软体机器人效率的洞察 

**Authors**: Yue Xie, Kai-feng Chu, Xing Wang, Fumiya Iida  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.16127)  

**Abstract**: Soft robotics holds transformative potential for enabling adaptive and adaptable systems in dynamic environments. However, the interplay between morphological and control complexities and their collective impact on task performance remains poorly understood. Therefore, in this study, we investigate these trade-offs across tasks of differing difficulty levels using four well-used morphological complexity metrics and control complexity measured by FLOPs. We investigate how these factors jointly influence task performance by utilizing the evolutionary robot experiments. Results show that optimal performance depends on the alignment between morphology and control: simpler morphologies and lightweight controllers suffice for easier tasks, while harder tasks demand higher complexities in both dimensions. In addition, a clear trade-off between morphological and control complexities that achieve the same task performance can be observed. Moreover, we also propose a sensitivity analysis to expose the task-specific contributions of individual morphological metrics. Our study establishes a framework for investigating the relationships between morphology, control, and task performance, advancing the development of task-specific robotic designs that balance computational efficiency with adaptability. This study contributes to the practical application of soft robotics in real-world scenarios by providing actionable insights. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 软体机器人为动态环境中的适应性和可适应系统提供了变革性的潜力。然而，形态学复杂性和控制复杂性之间的互动及其对任务性能的共同影响尚未完全理解。因此，在这项研究中，我们使用四种常用的形态学复杂性度量标准和使用FLOPs衡量的控制复杂性，在不同难度级别的任务中探讨这些权衡。通过运用演化机器人实验，我们研究这些因素如何共同影响任务性能。结果表明，最优性能依赖于形态和控制之间的匹配：简单的形态和轻量级的控制器足以应对较简单的任务，而较难的任务则需要两个维度的更高复杂性。此外，实现相同任务性能的形态学和控制复杂性之间存在明显的权衡。此外，我们还提出了一种敏感性分析，以揭示各个形态学度量对特定任务的贡献。本研究建立了一个研究形态学、控制与任务性能之间关系的框架，推动了在计算效率与可适应性之间平衡的特定任务机器人设计的发展。本研究通过提供实用的见解，促进了软体机器人在现实场景中的应用。

# Wearable Haptics for a Marionette-inspired Teleoperation of Highly Redundant Robotic Systems 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于木偶启发的高冗余度机器人系统远程操作的可穿戴触觉技术 

**Authors**: Davide Torielli, Leonardo Franco, Maria Pozzi, Luca Muratore, Monica Malvezzi, Nikos Tsagarakis, Domenico Prattichizzo

**Abstract**: The teleoperation of complex, kinematically redundant robots with loco-manipulation capabilities represents a challenge for human operators, who have to learn how to operate the many degrees of freedom of the robot to accomplish a desired task. In this context, developing an easy-to-learn and easy-to-use human-robot interface is paramount. Recent works introduced a novel teleoperation concept, which relies on a virtual physical interaction interface between the human operator and the remote robot equivalent to a "Marionette" control, but whose feedback was limited to only visual feedback on the human side. In this paper, we propose extending the "Marionette" interface by adding a wearable haptic interface to cope with the limitations given by the previous works. Leveraging the additional haptic feedback modality, the human operator gains full sensorimotor control over the robot, and the awareness about the robot's response and interactions with the environment is greatly improved. We evaluated the proposed interface and the related teleoperation framework with naive users, assessing the teleoperation performance and the user experience with and without haptic feedback. The conducted experiments consisted in a loco-manipulation mission with the CENTAURO robot, a hybrid leg-wheel quadruped with a humanoid dual-arm upper body. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 具有远程操作和移动操控能力的复杂自由度机器人远程操作对人类操作者构成挑战，操作者需要学习如何操控机器人的多个自由度以完成目标任务。在这种背景下，开发易于学习和使用的机器人-人类界面至关重要。 recent works引入了一种新颖的远程操作概念，该概念依赖于人类操作者与远程机器人之间的虚拟物理交互界面，类似于“木偶”控制，但之前的工作仅提供了视觉反馈。在这篇论文中，我们提出扩展“木偶”界面，通过添加可穿戴力反馈接口来应对之前工作的局限性。利用额外的力反馈模态，人类操作者能够完全控制机器人，并大大提高了对机器人响应及其与环境互动的意识。我们通过非专业用户评估了所提出的界面及其相关的远程操作框架，评估了有无力反馈条件下的远程操作性能和用户体验。实验内容包括使用CENTAURO机器人进行的移动操控任务，这是一种具有类人双臂上半身的混合腿轮四足机器人。

# A Laser-guided Interaction Interface for Providing Effective Robot Assistance to People with Upper Limbs Impairments 

**Title (ZH)**: 一种用于提供有效上肢功能障碍人士机器人辅助的激光引导交互界面 

**Authors**: Davide Torielli, Liana Bertoni, Luca Muratore, Nikos Tsagarakis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15987)  

**Abstract**: Robotics has shown significant potential in assisting people with disabilities to enhance their independence and involvement in daily activities. Indeed, a societal long-term impact is expected in home-care assistance with the deployment of intelligent robotic interfaces. This work presents a human-robot interface developed to help people with upper limbs impairments, such as those affected by stroke injuries, in activities of everyday life. The proposed interface leverages on a visual servoing guidance component, which utilizes an inexpensive but effective laser emitter device. By projecting the laser on a surface within the workspace of the robot, the user is able to guide the robotic manipulator to desired locations, to reach, grasp and manipulate objects. Considering the targeted users, the laser emitter is worn on the head, enabling to intuitively control the robot motions with head movements that point the laser in the environment, which projection is detected with a neural network based perception module. The interface implements two control modalities: the first allows the user to select specific locations directly, commanding the robot to reach those points; the second employs a paper keyboard with buttons that can be virtually pressed by pointing the laser at them. These buttons enable a more direct control of the Cartesian velocity of the end-effector and provides additional functionalities such as commanding the action of the gripper. The proposed interface is evaluated in a series of manipulation tasks involving a 6DOF assistive robot manipulator equipped with 1DOF beak-like gripper. The two interface modalities are combined to successfully accomplish tasks requiring bimanual capacity that is usually affected in people with upper limbs impairments. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 机器人技术在辅助肢体障碍人士增强日常生活独立性和参与度方面显示出显著潜力。在智能机器人界面部署后，预计将在家庭护理辅助方面产生社会长期影响。本研究介绍了一种旨在帮助上肢损伤者（如中风损伤患者）在日常活动中使用的交互界面。该交互界面利用了基于视觉伺服引导的组件，该组件采用了一种便宜但有效的激光发射器设备。通过在机器人工作空间内的表面投影激光，用户可以引导机器人 manipulator 至所需位置，完成抓取和操作物体的动作。考虑到目标用户，激光发射器佩戴在头部，使用户能够通过指向环境中的激光进行直观地控制机器人动作，并通过神经网络基于的感知模块检测激光的投影。交互界面实现了两种控制模式：第一种模式允许用户直接选择特定位置，并命令机器人前往这些点；第二种模式使用虚拟按键纸键盘，用户可以通过指向激光来虚拟按下一个按钮。这些按钮使用户能够更直接地控制末端执行器的笛卡尔速度，并提供附加功能，如命令抓取器的动作。本研究评估了该交互界面在操作一个配备单自由度喙式抓取器的六自由度辅助机器人执行一系列操作任务时的表现。两种交互模式的结合成功地完成了通常由于上肢损伤而受影响的双侧操作能力所需的任务。

**Title (ZH)**: 具有高功率密度的磁流变手部外骨骼开发，以增强握持耐力 

**Authors**: Wenbo Li, Xianlong Mai, Ying Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15915)  

**Abstract**: Hand exoskeletons have significant potential in labor-intensive fields by mitigating hand grip fatigue, enhancing hand strength, and preventing this http URL, most traditional hand exoskeletons are driven by motors whose output force is limited under constrained installation conditions. In addition, they also come with the disadvantages of high power consumption, complex and bulky assistive systems, and high this http URL this work, we develop a novel hand exoskeleton integrated with magnetorheological (MR) clutches that offers a high force-to-power ratio to improve grip endurance. The clutch features an enhanced structure design, a micro roller enhancing structure, which can significantly boost output forces. The experimental data demonstrate that the clutch can deliver a peak holding force of 380 N with a consumption of 1.48 W, yielding a force-to-power ratio of 256.75N/W, which is 2.35 times higher than the best reported actuator used for hand exoskeletons. The designed MR hand exoskeleton is highly integrated and comprises an exoskeleton frame, MR clutches, a control unit, and a battery. Evaluations through static grip endurance tests and dynamic carrying and lifting tests confirm that the MR hand exoskeleton can effectively reduce muscle fatigue, extend grip endurance, and minimize injuries. These findings highlight its strong potential for practical applications in repetitive tasks such as carrying and lifting in industrial settings.

# APEX-MR: Multi-Robot Asynchronous Planning and Execution for Cooperative Assembly 

**Title (ZH)**: APEX-MR：多机器人异步规划与协同装配执行 

**Authors**: Philip Huang, Ruixuan Liu, Changliu Liu, Jiaoyang Li  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15836)  

**Abstract**: Compared to a single-robot workstation, a multi-robot system offers several advantages: 1) it expands the system's workspace, 2) improves task efficiency, and more importantly, 3) enables robots to achieve significantly more complex and dexterous tasks, such as cooperative assembly. However, coordinating the tasks and motions of multiple robots is challenging due to issues, e.g. system uncertainty, task efficiency, algorithm scalability, and safety concerns. To address these challenges, this paper studies multi-robot coordination and proposes APEX-MR, an asynchronous planning and execution framework designed to safely and efficiently coordinate multiple robots to achieve cooperative assembly, e.g. LEGO assembly. In particular, APEX-MR provides a systematic approach to post-process multi-robot tasks and motion plans to enable robust asynchronous execution under uncertainty. Experimental results demonstrate that APEX-MR can significantly speed up the execution time of many long-horizon LEGO assembly tasks by 48% compared to sequential planning and 36% compared to synchronous planning on average. To further demonstrate the performance, we deploy APEX-MR to a dual-arm system to perform physical LEGO assembly. To our knowledge, this is the first robotic system capable of performing customized LEGO assembly using commercial LEGO bricks. The experiment results demonstrate that the dual-arm system, with APEX-MR, can safely coordinate robot motions, efficiently collaborate, and construct complex LEGO structures.

**Abstract (ZH)**: 多机器人系统相较于单机器人工作站具有多个优势：1) 扩展了系统的作业空间，2) 提高了任务效率，更重要的是，3) 使机器人能够实现更为复杂和灵巧的任务，例如协作装配。然而，协调多台机器人的任务和动作存在诸多挑战，包括系统不确定性、任务效率、算法可扩展性和安全性问题。为应对这些挑战，本文研究了多机器人协调，并提出了一种异步规划与执行框架APEX-MR，该框架旨在安全高效地协调多台机器人以实现协作装配，例如乐高装配。特别是，APEX-MR 为在不确定性条件下执行多次机器人任务和运动计划提供了一种系统性方法。实验结果表明，与顺序规划相比，APEX-MR 可以显著加速许多长期视角下的乐高装配任务的执行时间，平均速度快48%，同步规划平均速度快36%。为了进一步证明其性能，我们将APEX-MR 部署到双臂系统中执行物理乐高装配。据我们所知，这是首个能够使用商用乐高积木进行定制化乐高装配的机器人系统。实验结果表明，配备APEX-MR 的双臂系统能够安全协调机器人动作，高效协作并构建复杂的乐高结构。我们的项目网址可在此访问：[该网址]

# Control Pneumatic Soft Bending Actuator with Online Learning Pneumatic Physical Reservoir Computing 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于在线学习气动物理蓄水池计算的控制 pneumatically 软弯曲执行器 

**Authors**: Junyi Shen, Tetsuro Miyazaki, Kenji Kawashima  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15819)  

**Abstract**: The intrinsic nonlinearities of soft robots present significant control but simultaneously provide them with rich computational potential. Reservoir computing (RC) has shown effectiveness in online learning systems for controlling nonlinear systems such as soft actuators. Conventional RC can be extended into physical reservoir computing (PRC) by leveraging the nonlinear dynamics of soft actuators for computation. This paper introduces a PRC-based online learning framework to control the motion of a pneumatic soft bending actuator, utilizing another pneumatic soft actuator as the PRC model. Unlike conventional designs requiring two RC models, the proposed control system employs a more compact architecture with a single RC model. Additionally, the framework enables zero-shot online learning, addressing limitations of previous PRC-based control systems reliant on offline training. Simulations and experiments validated the performance of the proposed system. Experimental results indicate that the PRC model achieved superior control performance compared to a linear model, reducing the root-mean-square error (RMSE) by an average of over 37% in bending motion control tasks. The proposed PRC-based online learning control framework provides a novel approach for harnessing physical systems' inherent nonlinearities to enhance the control of soft actuators. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 软体机器人内在的非线性特性为其控制带来了挑战，但同时也赋予了丰富的计算潜力。复现计算（RC）在控制诸如软执行器这类非线性系统时显示出有效性。传统的RC可以通过利用软执行器的非线性动态扩展为物理复现计算（PRC）。本文介绍了一种基于PRC的在线学习框架，用于控制气动软弯曲执行器的运动，同时使用另一个气动软执行器作为PRC模型。与传统设计需要两个RC模型相比，提出的控制系统采用更紧凑的架构，仅使用一个RC模型。此外，该框架实现了零样本在线学习，解决了依赖离线训练的先前PRC控制系统的局限性。仿真和实验验证了所提系统的性能。实验结果表明，PRC模型在弯曲运动控制任务中实现了优于线性模型的控制性能，弯曲运动控制任务中的均方根误差（RMSE）平均降低超过37%。所提出的PRC基于的在线学习控制框架提供了一种利用物理系统固有的非线性特性以增强软执行器控制的新方法。

# Capturing a Moving Target by Two Robots in the F2F Model 

**Title (ZH)**: 两位机器人在F2F模型中捕捉移动目标 

**Authors**: Khaled Jawhar, Evangelos Kranakis  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15688)  

**Abstract**: We study a search problem on capturing a moving target on an infinite real line. Two autonomous mobile robots (which can move with a maximum speed of 1) are initially placed at the origin, while an oblivious moving target is initially placed at a distance $d$ away from the origin. The robots can move along the line in any direction, but the target is oblivious, cannot change direction, and moves either away from or toward the origin at a constant speed $v$. Our aim is to design efficient algorithms for the two robots to capture the target. The target is captured only when both robots are co-located with it. The robots communicate with each other only face-to-face (F2F), meaning they can exchange information only when co-located, while the target remains oblivious and has no communication capabilities.
We design algorithms under various knowledge scenarios, which take into account the prior knowledge the robots have about the starting distance $d$, the direction of movement (either toward or away from the origin), and the speed $v$ of the target. As a measure of the efficiency of the algorithms, we use the competitive ratio, which is the ratio of the capture time of an algorithm with limited knowledge to the capture time in the full-knowledge model. In our analysis, we are mindful of the cost of changing direction of movement, and show how to accomplish the capture of the target with at most three direction changes (turns). 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 我们在无限实线上研究捕获移动目标的搜索问题。两个自主移动机器人（最大移动速度为1）初始位于原点，而一个不知情的移动目标初始位于距离原点d的位置。机器人可以在直线上任意方向移动，但目标是不知情的，无法改变方向，以恒定速度v朝向或远离原点移动。我们的目标是设计高效的算法让两机器人捕获目标。目标仅在两机器人同时位于其位置时被捕获。机器人仅面对面（F2F）通信，意味着它们只能在同时位于同一位置时交换信息，而目标保持不知情且无法进行通信。我们在不同的知识场景下设计算法，考虑机器人关于起始距离d、移动方向（朝向或远离原点）和目标速度v的先验知识。我们以算法的竞争比为效率度量标准，这是算法在有限知识下的捕获时间与完全知识模型下捕获时间的比率。在分析中，我们考虑了改变移动方向的成本，并展示了如何最多通过三次方向改变（转弯）来完成目标的捕获。

# Robotic Paper Wrapping by Learning Force Control 

**Title (ZH)**: 基于学习力控制的机器人纸张包裹技术 

**Authors**: Hiroki Hanai, Takuya Kiyokawa, Weiwei Wan, Kensuke Harada  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15685)  

**Abstract**: Robotic packaging using wrapping paper poses significant challenges due to the material's complex deformation properties. The packaging process itself involves multiple steps, primarily categorized as folding the paper or creating creases. Small deviations in the robot's arm trajectory or force vector can lead to tearing or wrinkling of the paper, exacerbated by the variability in material properties.
This study introduces a novel framework that combines imitation learning and reinforcement learning to enable a robot to perform each step of the packaging process efficiently. The framework allows the robot to follow approximate trajectories of the tool-center point (TCP) based on human demonstrations while optimizing force control parameters to prevent tearing or wrinkling, even with variable wrapping paper materials.
The proposed method was validated through ablation studies, which demonstrated successful task completion with a significant reduction in tear and wrinkle rates. Furthermore, the force control strategy proved to be adaptable across different wrapping paper materials and robust against variations in the size of the target object. 

**Abstract (ZH)**: 使用包装纸进行机器人包装面临显著挑战，由于材料的复杂变形特性。包装过程涉及多个步骤，主要分为折叠纸张或形成褶皱。机器人手臂轨迹或力矢量的小偏差可能会导致纸张撕裂或起皱，而材料性质的变异性会加剧这一问题。

本研究引入了一种结合模仿学习和强化学习的新框架，以使机器人能够高效地完成包装过程的每个步骤。该框架使机器人能够在人类示范的基础上跟随工具中心点（TCP）的大致轨迹，同时优化力控制参数以防止撕裂或起皱，即使使用不同类型的包装纸材料也是如此。

# Impact of Extended Reality on Robot-Assisted Surgery Training 

**Title (ZH)**: 扩展现实对机器人辅助手术培训的影响 

**Authors**: Michael Bickford, Fayez Alruwaili, Sara Ragab, Hanna Rothenberg, Mohammad Abedin-Nasab  

**Link**: [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2503.15503)  

**Abstract**: Robot Assisted Surgeries (RAS) have one of the steepest learning curves of any type of surgery. Because of this, methods to practice RAS outside the operating room have been developed to improve the surgeons skills. These strategies include the incorporation of extended reality simulators into surgical training programs. In this Systematic review, we seek to determine if extended reality simulators can improve the performance of novice surgeons and how their performance compares to the conventional training of surgeons on Surgical robots. Using the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, a systematic review and meta-analysis was performed searching PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane library for studies that compared the performance of novice surgeons that received no additional training, trained with extended reality, or trained with inanimate physical simulators (conventional additional training). We included articles that gauged performance using either GEARS or Time to complete measurements and used SPSS to perform a meta-analysis to compare the performance outcomes of the surgeons after training. Surgeons trained using extended reality completed their surgical tasks statistically significantly faster than those who did not receive training (Cohen's d=-0.95, p=0.02), and moderately slower than those conventionally trained (Cohen's d=0.65, p=0.14). However, this difference was not statistically significant. Surgeons trained on extended reality demonstrated a statistically significant improvement in GEARS scores over those who did not train (Cohen's d=0.964, p<0.001). While surgeons trained in extended reality had comparable GEARS scores to surgeons trained conventionally (Cohen's d=0.65, p=0.14). This meta-analysis demonstrates that extended reality simulators translated complex skills to surgeons in a low cost and low risk environment.
