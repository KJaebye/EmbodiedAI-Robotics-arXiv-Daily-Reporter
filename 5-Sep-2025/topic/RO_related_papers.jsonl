DEXOP mechanically connects human fingers to robot fingers, providing users with direct contact feedback (via proprioception) and mirrors the human hand pose to the passive robot hand to maximize the transfer of demonstrated skills to the robot. The force feedback and pose mirroring make task demonstrations more natural for humans compared to teleoperation, increasing both speed and accuracy. We evaluate DEXOP across a range of dexterous, contact-rich tasks, demonstrating its ability to collect high-quality demonstration data at scale.

We propose the Lightweight Actuation Space Energy Modeling (LASEM) framework for cable driven continuum robots, which formulates actuation potential energy directly in actuation space. LASEM yields an analytical forward model derived from geometrically nonlinear beam and rod theories via Hamilton's principle, while avoiding explicit modeling of cable backbone contact. It accepts both force and displacement inputs, thereby unifying kinematic and static formulations. Assuming the friction is neglected, the framework generalizes to nonuniform geometries, arbitrary cable routings, distributed loading and axial extensibility, while remaining computationally efficient for real-time use. Numerical simulations validate its accuracy, and a semi-analytical iterative scheme is developed for inverse kinematics. To address discretization in practical robots, LASEM further reformulates the functional minimization as a numerical optimization, which also naturally incorporates cable potential energy without explicit contact modeling.", 'abstract_zh': '基于缆索驱动连续机器人的轻量级 actuation 空间能量模型框架（LASEM）', 'title_zh': '基于驱动空间能量公式的一种轻量化连续缆驱动机器人运动学与静态建模方法'}

Identifying paths that reveal the most unknown areas of the object becomes paramount in this context, as it directly affects efficiency, and this problem is known as the view path planning problem. Current methods often use sampling-based path planning techniques, evaluating potential views along the path to enhance reconstruction performance. However, these methods are computationally expensive as they require evaluating several candidate views on the path. To this end, we propose a computationally efficient solution that relies on calculating a focus point in the most informative (unknown) region and having the robot maintain this point in the camera field of view along the path. We incorporated this strategy into the whole-body control of a mobile manipulator employing a visibility constraint without the need for an additional path planner. We conducted comprehensive and realistic simulations using a large dataset of 114 diverse objects of varying sizes from 57 categories to compare our method with a sampling-based planning strategy using Bayesian data analysis. Furthermore, we performed real-world experiments with an 8-DoF mobile manipulator to demonstrate the proposed method's performance in practice.

The pose estimator is a critical component of wall climbing mobile robots, as their operational environment involves carrying precise measurement equipment and maintenance tools in construction, requiring information about pose on the building at the time of measurement. Due to the complex geometry and material properties of building facades, the use of traditional localization sensors such as laser, ultrasonic, or radar is often infeasible for wall-climbing robots. Moreover, GPS-based localization is generally unreliable in these environments because of signal degradation caused by reinforced concrete and electromagnetic interference. Consequently, robot odometry remains the primary source of velocity and position information, despite being susceptible to drift caused by both systematic and non-systematic errors. The calibrations of the robot's systematic parameters were conducted using nonlinear optimization and Levenberg-Marquardt methods as Newton-Gauss and gradient-based model fitting methods, while Genetic algorithm and Particle swarm were used as stochastic-based methods for kinematic parameter calibration.

Each agent independently learns its closed-loop behavior from experimental data by solving convex semidefinite programs that generate locally invariant ellipsoids and corresponding state-feedback gains. These ellipsoids, centered along grid-based waypoints, certify the dynamic feasibility of short-range transitions and define safe regions of operation. A sampling-based planner constructs a tree of such waypoints, where transitions are allowed only when adjacent ellipsoids overlap, ensuring invariant-to-invariant transitions and continuous safety. All agents expand their trees simultaneously and are coordinated through a space-time reservation table that guarantees inter-agent safety by preventing simultaneous occupancy and head-on collisions. Each successful edge in the tree is equipped with its own local controller, enabling execution without re-solving optimization problems at runtime.

Although CBFs are generally not inherently symmetric, we show how equivariances in the dynamics and symmetries in the constraints induce symmetries in CBFs derived through reachability analysis. This insight allows us to infer their CBF values across the entire domain from their values on a subset, leading to significant computational savings.
